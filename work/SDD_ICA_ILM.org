You store the archived data in archive files to which the system has read-only access. You have the following options for archiving data from SAP application systems: |

With this tool, most of the data elements which store personal data were already identified and stored. If you make use of a custom data element to store the personal data, then you may need to maintain the same with the tool. |

** Archiving Object 
Using AOBJ to create a archiving object: 
Involved Tables:
| Table Name      | Descirption                                       |
|-----------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| ICADOCM         | Matching Entries                                  |
| ICA_DOCH        | Matching Document Head                            |
| ICA_ASSIGN      | Assignments                                       |
| ICA_ASSIGN_ITEM | Items under an Assignment(Group Reference Number) |
| ICA_COMM_REC    | Communication Record                              |

Selection Options:
1. METHOD_ID
2. DOCNR
3. All fields in include structure "ICA_S_DIM" and "ICA_S_MFF".

*** Write Program
Write data from database to archive files.

Preprocessing is utilized as the test run. 
 
The ILM functions are implemented as enhancements of the data archiving write program (assuming that the write programs already use the standard includes for selection options). If this is not the case for your write program, carry out the standardization of your program as decribed in note 577847.

The options "Snapshot" and "Desctruction" would be added. 

*** Delete Program
Delete data from database according to the entries in the archive files.

*** Read Program
A simple read program is enough. 

Sequential read program will be used. 

Reload program would also be considerred. (Secondary Priority)

*** Archiving Class
Application log and background job Log

*** Maintain Table ADMI_CRIT
This table is required for currency conversions, for example, the changeover to the euro. It is used to specify which functions of an archiving object are seen as critical with regard to the currency conversions about to take place. In the case of new archiving objects this table still needs to be maintained. By default, all the functions (write, delete, reload, etc.) of a new archiving object are marked as critical. This may result in certain error messaging during the use of the archiving object.

To avoid this remove the indicators for the functions of your archiving object in table ADMI_CRIT using transaction HOSH, however, you must be sure that the archiving object does not interfere with currency conversions.

*** ILM Data Destruction. 
Archiving object actually is not mandatory, but the ILM data Destruction. 

** ILM Object
Registration of archiving object to ILM

The write program should also be adapted so that retention rules can be used to determine the storage location of the data.
