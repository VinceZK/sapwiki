* Business Background
The Manage Assignment App gives a view on the items from the 2 parties in a left-and-right view. You can do manual assign, check assignments, process assignments, and communicate with others in this App. 

* Features
1. Support 2 modes: 1) Matching Method, and 2) Recon Case. 
2. Filters and table columns are dynamically determined by the method or recon case chosen. 
3. Unassigned items are displayed seperately for the leading unit in the left table, and its partner units in the right table. 
4. Assigned items are grouped under assignment numbers which are displayed in the bottom table. 
5. The 3 tables' layout can be switched to expend either one or two.
6. Each table's columns can be personalized and saved as variants under a certain method.
7. You can manually assign items from the 3 tables and group them into one assignment number.
8. You can communicate with others, and the communication history is saved.
9. You can run auto-matching for a chosen pair of leading unit and partner unit.
10. You can define customize filters on assginments.
11. You can view details of an assignment.
12. You can process an assignment by giving a reason code.

* Test Cases
The following tests are using the Fiori App "Manage Assignments". It has 2 modes:

1. Matching Method mode: This mode asks for a matching method, and uses the meta of the matching method to render the UI. You can find it in business catalog: SAP_FIN_BC_ICA_ME_RUN.
2. Reconciliation Case mode: This mode asks for a recon case. As a recon case is always assigned with a matching method, this mode merges the meta from both the recon case and the matching method. So it shows some additional elements, like: Display Group, Currency, Trading Partner, Balanced amounts, and so on. You can find it in business catelog: SAP_FIN_BC_ICA_RECON_RUN.
 
** Access in Matching Method Mode
When entering this mode, you must first choose a Matchig Method ID. After that, filters and table columns can be determined. The filters are the leading unit field(s) plus the mandatory filter fields. They are derived from the underlying data source(s) of the method, so are the table columns. 

The filters are all mandatory and single. Some filter fields are prompted with default values, like fiscal year, fiscal period, and fiscal year period. The labels of the filter fields are derived from their underlying data elements(head text) if not specified in the "Field Sementics" of the underlying data source. Search helps are only derived from the field's data element.

After giving the filter values and clicking "Go" button, the system reads matching items related to the leading unit. Which includes all the items that are belong to the leading unit, as well as the items that are belong to its partner units with their partner unit in turn equal to the leading unit. The unassigned items of the leading unit are displayed in the top-left table, the unassigned items of its partner units are displayed in the top-right table. The assigned items, grouped by assignment numbers, are displayed in the bottom table. 

The bottom table displays assignments. Once assignments are chosen, the matching items belong to the assignments will be shown right beside. The bottom-right table should have all the columns from the 2 top tables, since an assignment groups items from the 2 tables above. 

The column sequence of the 3 tables by default follows the sequence in the CDS views that are assigned to the data sources. The exceptions are for those matching engine context fields. "Proc. Status", "Comm. Status", and "Comm. Due Date" are by default positioned at the beginning. "Matching Doc" and "Matching Doc Items" are placed at the end. For other enviroment context fields, like "Client" and "Matching Method ID", they are just hidden.  

** TODO Customize Layout
The layout can be customized by leveraging the standard Fiori filter variant and table variant. You can save variants either privately or publicly.

*** DONE It should save filter variant as default and load automatically next time.

*** TODO It should save table variant as default and load automatcially next time.
Table variant includes: column postion, column width, show/hide columns, and column sorting. Column filtering is not recommanded to save to variants, as it may introduce confusion. 

3 tables are involved: 1) Leading Unit: Unassigned Items(upper-left), 2) Partner Unit(s): Unassigned Items(upper-right), 3) Assigned Items(lower-right).  They should behave the same in table variant management. 

** DONE Unassigned Items of Leading Unit
The upper-left table shows all unassigned items of the leading unit. Unassigned items means their processing status is between '00' and '19'. 

*** DONE It should display items correctly.
1. Items are belong to the leading unit.
2. Items are with processing status between '00' and '19'.
3. Items fulfill the mandatory filters.
4. Items newly posted are display in processing status '00'.

*** DONE Field Navigation
You can configure navigation links on each field that are available in the Data Source. If only one navigation is set on a field, then the field is displayed as a singl link. If multiple navigations are set on a field, then it will show a pop-over dialog of the configured links.

*** DONE Set Filters and Sorters on Columns
You can choose a column by right clicking the field to show the context menu, in which you can find the sort and filter options. You can also click the wheel on the table's upper-right corner, in which you can set filter and sorter on mulitple columns.

*** DONE Fuzzy Search
You can do fuzzy search on the items by clicking the "Fuzzy Search" button. A dialog pops up, in which the result will be immediately shown when you are typing. The selection of items can be transfered to the underlying table.

** DONE Unassigned Items of Partner Units
The upper-right table shows all unassigned items whose tradinng partner is the chosen leading unit. The table allows switching among the partner units.

*** DONE It should display items correctly.
1. Items whose partner unit is the chosen unit.
2. Items are with processing status between '00' and '19'.
3. Items fulfill the mandatory filters.
4. Items newly posted are display in processing status '00'.

*** DONE Switch among Partner Units
The dropdown-box in the table toolbar allows switching among partner units. Once a partner unit is chosen, the table only list items that are belong to the partner unit. You can also choose "All" to list all the items.
  
** Assigned Items
The bottom table shows all assignments that belong to the leading unit. Each assignment contains assigned items that either the leading unit field or the partner unit field is equal to the value of leading unit. Assigned items have the processing status between '20' and '30'.

*** DONE It should show assigned items when assignment numbers are checked.
The assigned items are grouped by assignment numbers. And once the assignment numbers are checked, the contained assigned items are shown in the lower-right table. By default, the assigned items are collapsed by the assignment numbers. Only the amount and currency type field will still show aggregated value. You can expend items either by an individual assignment or by clicking the "Expand" button on the toolbar to expand all. 

** TODO Customization Filters
You can define customization filters in Tcode: ICAFC. Once defined, they will be shown in the dropdown-list together with the standard ones in the assignment table toolbar. By default, filter "S_FROM_LAST_ONE_MONTH" is selected. 

*** DONE It should show all assignment when choosing "Show All".

*** DONE It should show assignments that their processing status is between 20 and 29 when choosing "Show Assigned but Note Matched".

*** TODO It should show assignment that the creation date is from last one month when choosing "Show Assignments Created from Last 1 Month".
It will show items that were created 30 days before.

*** DONE It should show unassigned assignments when choosing "Show Unassigned".
Unassigned assignments are those obsolete ones, with the field "UNASSIGNED" equal to "X" in table ICA_ASSIGN.

*** TODO Define Customization Filters using ICAFC.
User can define his own filters on 5 dimensions: 1) CREATE_DATE: Assignment Creation Date, 2) DIFFERENCE: Difference on WSL, 3) PSTAT: Processing Status, 4) RCODE: Reason Code, 5) RULE_ID: Matching Rule ID. 

** Manually Assign Items for One-Data-Source Methods
You can choose items from the 2 upper tables and click the "Assign" button. A dialog then pops up to allow you input a reason code. Based on the settings of the reason code, the system processes the assignment differently. If the reason code doesn't require any follow-ups, the assignment is directly set to the processing status "30". If the reason code requires a comment, then you have to input some comments, otherwise, you are not allowed to assign. If the reason code is attached with a workflow, then the system triggers a workflow instance once you assign. If the reason code is attached with an auto-adjustment Class, then the auto-adjustment is conducted together with the assigning.  

Note: 
1. Items with processing status "00" cannot be manually assigned. You must first run an auto-matching to roll-in them. 
2. If you choose items which are not in the same leading unit and partner unit pair, then the system gives you an error: "Select only the items with the same leading unit and partner unit pair so that they can be grouped into one assignment." For example, following items cannot be assigned:
| Company | Trading Partner | Amount |
|---------+-----------------+--------|
| E3      | E1              |    100 |
| E1      | E5              |   -100 |

You can also add items from the upper 2 tables to an existing assignment. However, you must fulfill following requisites: 
1. Only one assignment number is selected.
2. The selected assignment must be in processing status '20', and the workflow status is not in processing if it has a workflow instance attached.
3. At least, one item from the upper 2 tables is selected.
4. The added items must be in the same leading unit and partner unit pair as the existing assignment.
5. Items must share the same leading unit with the assignment. Under an assignment, items belong to the leading unit have the value of "SLICE" equal to 1, while items belong to the partner unit have the value of "SLICE" equal to 2. If you are in company A as the leading unit, and add items from the upper 2 tables to an assignment which has company B as the leading unit, the error will occur.  You need to switch leading unit to company B, and find the same items from the partner unit table, then the assignment should work. 

** TODO Manually Assign Items for Two-Data-Sources Methods


** Unassign Assignments
You can unassign an assignment if you think it is no longer valid. Even assignments with processing status "30" can be unassigned. Only assignments that are in workflow processing status are temporary blocked for unassignment. 

Once unassigned, the assignment number is obsolete. However, you can still find it by switching to the customization filter "Show Unassign". You can even open an unassigned assignment to check the items that it once grouped. The unassigned items have the processing status "05", and will be shown in the upper tables.  

** Auto Match
You can trigger an auto-matching by hitting the button "Auto Matching". It will schedule a background job which is immediately run in the backend S4HANA system. If you don't close the App, the UI keeps on polling the status of the job until the job either finished successfully or failed.

During the matching run, buttons "Assign" and "Auto Match" are disabled. Under the hood, the leading unit and its partner units are locked to prevent the concurrency runs. If you filter in only one partner unit in the upper-right table, then only the leading unit and the chosen partner unit are locked. Otherwise, all the partner units in the upper-right table will be locked together with the leading unit. 

After you get a job ending signal, either successfully if you see the tables are getting refreshed and the buttons are enabled agian, or failed if you see an error message dialog pops up, the involved units are getting unlocked. You can check the locking status in Tcode "ICAAM".

*** DONE It should disable the buttons when auto-match is running.
Buttons need to be disabled: Assign and Auto Match.

*** DONE It should refresh the tables when auto-match is successfully finished.

*** DONE It should popup an error dialog when auto-match runs into errors.

*** DONE It should unlock involved units when job is finished either successfully or failed. 

*** DONE It should check the lastest assignments when auto-match finished successfully.
The latest created assignments(in 10 minutes) are checked in the lower-left table so that their grouped items are shown in the lower-right table. This gives better user experience as he/she can see the changes immediately after the he doing  manual assign or auto-match. 

*** DONE It should block concurrent auto-match run.
An error message should show "Matching run xxxxx is locked in another background job".

*** DONE It should block concurrent manual assign/unassign and communication.
When there is a concurrent matching is running b for some units, then the manual assign/unassign of the units will be blocked. Communication is also blocked for the units. 

** Matching Detail Page
This page shows all information related to an assignment. If the processing status is "20", you still have the chance to switch to other reason code and process the follow-ups. 

The matching result is seperated into 2 slices, the upper shows all items belong the leading unit,  and the lower is for items of the partner unit. Fields that are used in the matching rule's expressions are placed at the begining, and sequenced the same as the matching expressions. The value of matching fields are in 2 colors: Green and Orange. If the expression comparator is "=" or "Opposite", then the field value is in green, otherwise, in orange.

*** DONE It should show the "process" button when the processing status is 20.

*** DONE It should block you unassign when the workflow is not in ending status.
The ending status of workflow instance could be: ERROR, CANCELLED, EXCPCAUGHT, EXPHANDLR, SUCCESS, COMPLETED, and COIMMITTED. 

*** DONE It should allow you unassign when workflow status is in ending status, or there is no workflow.
You can unassign any assignments with workflow in ending status, or there is just no workflow instance attached. However, you cannot unassign an already unassigned assignment.

When unassigned, the assignment is tagged in "Unassign" status. You can only view it, and cannot do any operations on it.  

*** DONE It should show "WAITING" when workflow instance is initially triggerred.
In the "WAITING" status, the workflow instance is not initilized, and notification is also not sent. You cannot find it in workflow inbox. When the status is changed to "STARTED", it will be shown in inbox, and notification is also sent. 

*** TODO It should allow you navigate to the matching method and rule
The navigation to the matching method and matching is in-App. When navigating away, the change should be temporary saved in the client, so that it is protected when navigating back.

*** DONE It should show "Related Links" when you assign a reason code with related links attached.

*** DONE It should show application log when you process a reason code with AA Class.

** Workflow

*** TODO Triger Workflow during Manual Assign 
The workflow status doesn't display "WAITING" when trigerred. 


** Communication
