** General Rules

** Naming Conventions Rules
Please refer the following link for naming conventions of OData and UI: [[https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/fiorisuite/Naming+Conventions+for+Development+Objects][Naming Conventions for Development Objects]].

** Best Practices

It would be benefit if one can manually upload the Fiori Application into ABAP repository. There is a [[https://blogs.sap.com/2016/06/28/deploy-web-ide-developed-fiori-application-to-local-abap-repository/][blog]] on SCN describes the detail, however, after testing, it is not work in the new SAPUI5 version or infrastructure.

** Quick Start & How to Learn

*** Your First Fiori App
By following the [[https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1700398221][step-by-step guide]], it is easy to implement your first Fiori app.

1. Create a CDS view "ZVINCE130_U" based on the base view generated by modeling tool. 
2. Follow the steps in the above guide to finish your first Fiori app.

*** Fiori Launchpad Configuration
This part introduce how you embed your applications into the Fiori Launchpad, or vice verser, how you find an existing application from Launchpad to the backend services. 

1. If your applications are legacy SAPGUI or WebDynpro, then you should define your Backend Catalogs. Please use this [[https://ldcier9.wdf.sap.corp:44300/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/sui_tm_mm_app?sap-language=EN&sap-client=500#][tool]] to create your Backend Catalogs and refer the [[https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/SimplSuite/Maintenance+of+Frontend+and+Backend+Catalogs][wikipage]] for detail;
2. You may need to apply semantic objects;
3. You create your catalogs and business groups in [[https://wdciw04.wdf.sap.corp:1301/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/arsrvc_upB_admn/main.html?sap-client=902scope=CUST][Fiori LaunchPad Designer]](FLP Designer). Please follow the [[https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/SimplSuite/UI+-+Related+Naming+Conventions%252C+Packages+and+Software+Components][naming conventions]];
5. You create PFCG roles and assign launchpad catalogs and groups into the roles, *this task should be done in Frontend Server*;
6. Finally, you assign SAP users to the PFCG role, and then open the [[https://wdciw04.wdf.sap.corp:1301/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/arsrvc_upB_admn/main.html?sap-client=902scope=CUST][Launchpad]] will see your tiles.

You can find more details steps in the [[https://help.sap.com/saphelp_uiaddon10/helpdata/en/f9/51b50a07ce41deb08ced62711fe8b5/content.htm?current_toc=/en/bd/e12a271f0647e799b338574cda0808/plain.htm&show_children=true][online help]] link. However, you will find you do not have the authorization to do user/role assignments. You have to apply Business Roles by using the DLM self service tool: https://vmw4958.wdf.sap.corp:44344/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/zdlm_nav_role?sid=UXT&clnt=902. For example, you add the existing business role "SAP_BR_GL_ACCOUNTANT".

Incase you want to find the Fiori code and the backend service, you can process in following steps:

1. You find roles assigned to your SAP user in the Frontend Server. For example, SAP_BR_GL_ACCOUNTANT;
2. Open "SAP_BR_GL_ACCOUNTANT" using PFCG, try to compare the description of the group and find the its technique name. For example, "General Reporting" has the technical name "SAP_SFIN_BCG_GL_GEN_REP";
3. Use [[https://wdciw04.wdf.sap.corp:1301/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/arsrvc_upB_admn/main.html?scope=CUST&sap-client=902#][FLP Designer]] open the group "SAP_SFIN_BCG_GL_GEN_REP", find the tile of the app click the "i" icon to see the catalog's ID. You can double click the catalog link to navi to the catalog detail;
4. Switch to the tab "Target Mapping", find the semantic object ("FinancialStatement" for example), click "Configure" in the buttom toolbar;
5. In the detail page of the mapping, you can find the ID of the application(that is "fin.gl.finstatement.display");
6. Open [[https://projectportal.neo.ondemand.com][project portal]] to search "fin.gl.finstatement.display", click to see the detail of the Fiori project, like: BPS name, ABAP package, Software Component, and so on;
7. You can view the code by either cloning to your Web IDE, or view it in web pages(Browse Sources in Gitiles). Find in manifest.json, and look for "dataSources". You can find the gateway service name("FAC_FINANCIAL_STATEMENT" for example);
8. You open "FAC_FINANCIAL_STATEMENT" using SEGW in the Backend Server, and read or debug the backend codes.
