** Design
*** Key Requirements and Design Goals
Data Modeling is the prerequisite for consolidation. It defines the master data, customizing data, and transactional data that consolidation tasks are running on. 

To be more specifically, data modeling can be characterized by:
1. Define Currencies;
2. Define Versions;
3. Define Data Foundations and Consolidation Area;
4. Consolidation Tasks, Document Type, and Consolidation Methods;
5. Financial Statement Items, and Consolidation Chart of Accounts(Hierarchy);
6. Subassigments and Breakdown Categories;
7. Consolidation Units and Groups;

**** Following Design Goals *MUST* be Met:
1. Fully take advantages of HANA and S/4 architecture;
2. Modeling artifacts can be consumed by BPC;
3. Performance must be guarantee for the generated modeling artifacts.

**** Following Design Goals *SHOULD* be Met:
1. Modeling tools should be intuitive and fulfill most of the consolidation requirements;
2. Modeling tools should provide error-proof features to avoid data inconsistency.


*** Context
As mentioned, Modeling is the prerequisite for consolidation. There are lots of master data, customizations, settings, and even system configurations should be prepared before consolidation tasks actually run.

It is a heavy task that could be done by different roles includes: system administrators for connectivities, consultants, developers, and accountants. But after modelings perfectly set, consolidation tasks can be run smoothly and recursively.  

Most terminologies and concepts of financial consolidation appears during modeling. Some of them are vital and should be carefully chosen among BCS, EC-CS, BPC, and G/L Accounting. We try to make Real-time Consolidation be more simpler and straight forward. 
 
**** G/L Account or Financial Statement Item
RTC can use G/L Accounts to do consolidation, thus sharing the same set of account master data. But we still have doubts on why LC and EC-CS added FS item into their context? If there is good reasons to have an additional set of account master data for consolidation other than G/L Account?

**** Consolidation Chart of Account
Chart of Accounts is optional in BCS. Because you can use multiple hierarchies of account in an info-object. EC-CS has its own consolidation COA, but you can map cons COA to a G/L COA.

EC-CS COA is assigned with FS item hierarchies which contains has FS items represented in a hierarchy view. G/L COA has FSV instead. Table bellow describes the correspondences between EC-CS and G/L Accounting.

| *EC-CS*          | EC-CS COA | FS Item Hierarchy | FS Item | FS Item Set |
| *G/L Accounting* | G/L COA   | FSV               | Account | Account Set |

 Should verify if FS item hierarchy has something to do with SET and HRRP. 

**** Ledger
Reuse G/L ledger or EC-CS ledger? It seems BCS doesn't have the ledger concept.

The G/L ledger contains =Company Codes=. All the configurations are maintained on each company code. While in EC-CS, the ledger doesn't contain any company code, and all the configurations are globally maintained on ledger. 

Considering if I want to do profit center consolidation, then what's meaning of ledger of profit centers? 

**** Version
In G/L Accounting, =Version= (or field RVERS) is absolute and remained only for the reason of compatibility. IBPF uses the combination of  =Ledger= and  =Category= for its version dimension. 

Do we need the field =RVERS= or not? If yes, do we reuse BCS' or EC-CS'?

**** Flow or Accounting Types Combination
BPC uses =Flow= to distinguish different journal items that are generated during different consolidation tasks. User then use the =Flow= dimension to filter the data he wants for different reporting purposes. 

In Accounting, we have =Document Type=, =Transaction Type=, and  =Business Transaction= to differentiate types of journal items that are generated by different components and different purposes.

The question is: does RTC need BPC's =Flow= concept, or we still use accounting types combination? =Flow= is a more generic concept that although it is very abstract, but once you understand it, you can do everything with it. The accounting types combination may be more useful for FI applications, but they are even inexplicable for people outside SAP FI.

We need keep this in mind during development.
 
**** Consolidation Unit/Dimension and Group 
BCS defines its cons unit by assigning ~Cons Unit~ role to info-objects, like: company, profit center, cost center, and so on. And cons group is an attribute of a cons unit info-object.

EC-CS has both maintenance views for cons unit and cons group. Additionally, EC-CS has the concept =Dimension=. The consolidation unit depends on the dimension in which it was created. This means that the master record you create for a consolidation unit exists only in that dimension.

Despite the different representation, the basic idea of cons unit and cons group are rather same. No mater it is in BCS or EC-CS. And Even BPC has very similar concepts. 

RTC may reuse the tables and maintenance views of EC-CS to define its own =Unit & Group=. Then try to map and synchronize them to the corresponding objects in BPC.

**** Consolidation Area
Consolidation Area only appears in BCS. In BPC the similar concept is consolidation environment without completely match. Consolidation area is to define a subsets of characteristic fields and amount fields from data basis tables (like ACDOCA). Meanwhile, permanent values are defined for filtering and default values. 

Permanent values could include: Version, Fiscal Year, Period, and all possible fields you can define to boundary a consolidation campaign. 

Consolidation Methods and Tasks are also assigned to consolidation area.

In EC-CS, there is no such concept, instead it has =Global Parameter=. The global parameters includes dimension, Cons Unit/Group, Version, Fiscal Year, Period, and so on. These information can be accessed among all the consolidation tasks. The limitation is that EC-CS only allows single dimension consolidation, thus not such flexible as BCS.

**** Subitem and Subitem Category
Subitems mean =Sub Financial Statement Item=. They are used to further differentiate(breakdown) the values of a =Financial Statement Item=. 

For example, the financial statement for cash can have subitems of banks. It stands for the corp has multiple cash accounts of different banks. And in each bank, the subitem can be further breakdown by different currencies. The =Account Receivable= item can be breakdown by customers, then each customer number is a subitem. The advantage is saving namespaces of FS items, there is no need to create a FS item for each customer. 

=Subitem Category= is the total domain of subitems, or you can say a subitem contains a sub-domain of subitem category. Take sales region as an example, you can define a subitem with 3 regions of "Europe, Asia, Africa". The subitem is belong to the subitem category "Region" which may stand for all the sale regions on the earth. 

=Subitem= and =Subitem Category= together is called =Subassignment=. In BCS, only =Subassignment= is used. And multiple subassignments can be grouped by =Breakdown Category=. 

It's just too much concepts and layers here. Think if can be simplified during development.


*** Major Building Blocks  
Modeling can contain many things, in this SDD, we only talk about master/customization data and schema(meta) definition for a consolidation. Other topics like system connectivity, data collection, and so on may exceed the area of consolidation itself.

The master/customization data maintenance is quite straight forward once all the concepts are clear and defined. The tool can either be auto-generated maintenance views, or specifically developed UIs and APIs for both manual and batch input. 

Schema definition or what we call =Data Modeling= can be the main development stuff. Tools are developed to allow users easily define the schema of their consolidation data. All the consolidation tasks are running on this data schema and producing consolidated results.
 
2 branches for data modeling are considered. One(Branch1) is modeling only for BPC which has no specific settings on RTC side. User only need to creaet a view and a virtual-provider on ACDOCA, let BPC do all the stuff left. The other(Branch2) is modeling for both RTC and BPC which requires a tighter integration between RTC and BPC. Following diagram describes details of the approach.  

#+Caption: Data Modeling at Design Time
[[../image/DataModelingDesignTime.png]]

The first step is creating a foundation view on ACDOCA(and other tables if necessary). The foundation view projects fields from ACDOCA (and joined or union-ed other data sources), apply filters(where conditions), do field mappings and alignments. This can be achieved using CDS modeling technology which is a generic database modeling technology that can fulfill almost anything. 

User should ensure the performance of the foundation view, because most of the consolidation tasks afterwords are pumping data from it. 

The foundation view is then assigned to a consolidation model, which is boundary definition of a consolidation campaign for specific purposes. You can also assign a consolidation journal table other than ACDOCC(default one), and do field mapping with the foundation view. Those 2 steps are in dotted rectangles because they are optional. In RTC's early releases, only ACDOCA and ACDOCC will be involved, so there is no need to do fields mappings, as the 2 tables share most of the field names. 

A new CDS view will be generated which would union the foundation view and the consolidation journal table(ACDOCC). This CDS view is called =Consolidation Area View=. The =Consolidation Area View= will be the basis for all the consolidation tasks. HRF Vocabulary can also be formed based on it so that rules can be defined.
 
Versions can be defined to allow parallel consolidations in the same consolidation environment according to different aspects. For example, actual and plan, US GAAP and IFRS. You can use 2 fields: =Data Category= and =Accounting Principle= to define various version combinations. Each combination can have its specific customizations, like consolidation frequency, and so on.

Based on above definitions, you can run validations to check if all the setting are right, and activate the consolidation model. Following rules could be checked:

1. If correct filters are set;
2. If all mandatory fields are projected;
3. Fields are correctly mapped to ACDOCC;
4. All necessary fixed parameters and values are set;
5. If settings on RTC and BPC are consistent. 

After successfully activation, the consolidation model can run consolidation tasks.

~If possible, there will also a HANA calculation view be generated based on consolidation journal table(ACDOCC) for the consumption of BPC.~

 Consolidation journals generated from tasks are then posted to ACDOCC,  which can then be consumed directly by S/4 applications or be accessed by BPC for further consolidation tasks. 

Above steps are involved in =Branch2= which is data modeling for both RTC and BPC. The =Branch1= for BPC is off-the-peg. User can just use HANA Studio to create calculation views and use composite info-providers to let BPC directly consume data in ACDOCA. The consolidated results will be saved in a real-time cube. 

User can either choose do all the consolidation tasks in BPC, or some of tasks (like currency translation and simple elimination) in RTC. The former one needs to access data in ACDOCA, and the latter one access data in ACDOCC. The advantages of the ACDOCC approach are:
1. High quality raw consolidation data;
2. Better performance, as some validation, aggregation, and mapping are already done beforehand. 


**** Consolidation Model Definition UI                                  :Sam:
A consolidation model is the most parent object that contains everything. Here I list few that would be delivered in the initial release:
1. *Data Stream* defines the consolidation data views, and journal table to persist consolidation result.
2. *Integration* contains options and controls of how S/4 provides data to BPC, and how BPC write-back to S/4.
3. *Version* defines the version fields combinations, and version specific settings.
4. *Assignment* assigns FI objects like consolidation unit, partner unit, CoA, and Fiscal Year Variant.
5. *Admin* additional settings control how the consolidation model is used. 

For how to read BPC model's meta data, please refer the class: CL_RSBPCO_APPL_ADAPTER

**** Version, Ledger, Category Master Data Maintenance UI     :Lynn:
*Version* in consolidation means different copies of consolidated results for different purposes under a same consolidation area. So that although there are some differences among these versions, but they share most of the common master data and settings. For example, based on the same actual financial data, chart of accounts, and organizational structure, you can do consolidation for US GAAP, or IFRS.

But "Version" has a board meanings, for example, a program has multiple versions. Consolidation versions stand for a combination of different characteristic fields, like: Actual/GAAP/Legal, Plan/IFRS/Management. How many characteristic fields are involved to form a version combination can be freely defined by customers. There comes confusion between version-related fields and version itself. 

For example, the last field in the tab2 mock UI names ~Version~ too. But actually, it stands for the VERSN field in COEP. Add this field is only for the data integration with CO. The right 4 fields combination is called a consolidation version which is assigned with a version ID of 001. They all call ~version~ in different context. 

You develop a customization table for version ID definition. Refer EC-CS' table: TF200 and TF201. 

~There are still some uncertainties about BCS' version combination. Actually, version ID and version combination are 2 redundant information.~   

*Ledger* in consolidation is combined with =Accounting Principle=. You can just regard them as the same thing at concept level. So =Ledger= is also a version-related field used in version combination. You develop a customization table to allow user store different ledgers and ledger level settings. You can refer EC-CS' ledger customization.

*Category* is used to specify the consolidation purpose for, take an example, plan or actual. Try to reuse IBPF's existing category maintenance view: FCOMV_CATEGORY

*Valuation* missing information. Need Ying's verification.
 
Version is the most complicate configurations in consolidation. You can refer EC-CS and BCS to see how they realize the consolidation version. Regarding with RTC, in its initial release, we should only pick the essential parts of them. 

**** Foundation View Validation Method        :Lynn:
When the foundation view is assigned to a consolidation area, combined with other settings on consolidation area, there are rules should be check and validated. These rules could be(no more less):
1. If correct filters are set;
2. If all mandatory fields are projected;
3. Fields are correctly mapped to ACDOCC;
4. If consolidation area view is correctly generated;
5. All necessary fixed parameters and values are set.

To achieve this, you should read the meta data of the CDS view. Please refer ABAP program: ~WB_DDLS_API_EXAMPLE_PROG~ to get idea on how to access CDS view source. 

You should reuse SAP application log (SLG0&SLG1) to show the check result. You can also refer ABAP class: ZCL_BG_LOG in S4H.

**** Foundation View                                                  :Frank:
Foundation view is the main source of consolidation data, based on what consolidation tasks are run to produce consolidated results. 

In the initial releases, the source data is mainly coming from ACDOCA. You need to create a CDS view on ACDOCA and do necessary fields projections and data filtering.  There are also mapping and derivations need to be done at CDS level:
1. Operational Account --> Group Account
2. Company Code --> Company
3. Fiscal Year Period Alignment. [[http://help.sap.com/saphelp_470/helpdata/en/dc/f18b884efb11d39a350000e8a5999a/content.htm?frameset=/en/58/8e6a3c32853960e10000000a11402f/frameset.htm&current_toc=/en/5c/c1c25f445f11d189f00000e81ddfac/plain.htm&node_id=86][Check in KM]]

~We need an additional ABAP program to generate fiscal calendar data by day level. The program will take the fiscal year variant as input parameter, and then generates day level granularity fiscal calendar data into a specific table.~ 

Text fields should be avoided to join here. And field names should keep unchanged. The foundation CDS view should also avoid to use parameters as HANA calculation view can not consume parameterized CDS view. 

**** Field Projection and Role Assignment
Fields are projected from data foundation tables, like ACDOCA or ACDOCC. These fields are categorized into certain groups. Some groups are mandatory for consolidation, and even the number of fields is fixed. Based on existing knowledge from BCS and EC-CS, I category fields into following groups:

#+Caption: Field Projection & Role Assignment
[[../image/FieldRoleAssignment.png]]

User first assigns a foundation table/view, then the above screen is pop up to let user project fields, assigned roles, and set permanent parameters. Only certain groups are allowed to set permanent parameters, these parameters will be represented as ~where~ and ~group~ statement during CDS view generation.

Some groups are mandatory, for example ~Consolidation Unit/Dimension~, you must at least assign one field (at maximum two) for this group of fields. ~Financial Statement Item~ is also mandatory. 

This UI representation of field projection and role assignment is tailored to ACDOCA table. It should be flexible enough for other tables. So templates will be designed which allow user to using exist settings. For example, template for ACDOCA should already have some field assigned for those  mandatory field groups. User can also extend the view and save as their own templates.

**** Generate Consolidation Area CDS View 
There are existing APIs to allow ABAP generates CDS views. Transportation is also utilized in the set of APIs which allow the generated CDS views can be transported from DEV to QA, and to Product system.

The demo ABAP program is: WB_DDLS_API_EXAMPLE_PROG

More details can be found in: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/TIPABAPVB/CDS+DDL+API+Description

*** Design Challenges resulting from Non-Functional Requirements
*** User Interface                                                    

**** Initial Screens and Data Stream Tab
#+Caption: Consolidation Model UI: Data Stream
[[../image/ConsEnvDefinationUI_1.png]]

You can create a consolidation model in the initial screen by entering a model name (6 char long). Existing check and lock check will be made to make sure the model name is available. You can also display or change an existing model. A model cannot be deleted once it is activated, but it can be de-activated forbidden to use. You can also do checks on a model to make sure all the settings distributed between BPC and S/4 are consistent. The check result will be showed in a pop up dialog as screen 900.

When you create a model, the second screen 200 will pop up to let you enter a consolidation foundation view. It is a CDS view based on ACDOCA which has realized fields projection, data filtering, CoA mapping and fiscal year period alignment. You can also choose to un-check the check box of "Integrate with BPC".  By default it is checked which means a new consolidation area view will be generated based on the foundation view. The differences between area view and foundation view are bellow:

1. Consolidation area view will union the consolidated result in ACDOCC with the actual data in ACDOCA.
2. Consolidation area view  will add 2 additional columns: =Model= and =Category=. The value of field =Model= is the 6 chars long model name; and the value of =Category= is fixed as "ACTUAL" if data comes from ACDOCA, otherwise it is mapped to the =BPC Category= field in ACDOCC. 

BPC can then access the real-time data in S/4 through the consolidation area view. 

If "Currency Translation in S4H" is checked, then currency translation will be done in S/4. The translated result is saved in ACDOCC. BPC should only access data in ACDOCC. It is not necessary to union data in ACDOCA as BPC won't do currency translation again. Then the consolidation area view is generated only based on ACDOCC. 

Click the "OK" button will do the generation work. If everything is OK, then screen 300 is showed to allow further maintenance for the model. You can add a description for the model, or you can change the consolidation foundation view. But once you changed, you could possible need to re-generate the area view. ACDOCC is fixed as the consolidation journal table in the initial releases. But we will consider if users are allowed to enter their own journal table to add more flexibility.  

That's all about the =Data Stream= tab. In future it will allow multiple foundation views, like inventory data view, investment data view, and so on.  

**** Integration Tab
#+Caption: Consolidation Model UI: Integration
[[../image/ConsEnvDefinationUI_2.png]]

In the =Integration= tab, you define more details settings for the integration with BPC. You add a BPC consolidation environment and a BPC model which is created in BPC's web console before-hand. The BPC model's meta data is then read when you click the "Enter" key. If "Currency Translation in S4H" is checked, you should assign a translation method. Click the "Ownership Hierarchy" will navigate to a hierarchy view dialoge. The data is real-time read from BPC's ownership cube. 

~BPC has exposed an interface to allow you read data in its ownership cube: CL_RSBPCO_APPL_ADAPTER!~

**** Version Tab
#+Caption: Consolidation Model UI: Version
[[../image/ConsEnvDefinationUI_3.png]]

Version is used to execute parallel consolidations according to different aspects. You can define multiple versions for a consolidation model. The consolidation result then will be saved with version information tagged. Each version is defined as a combination of one or multiple version fields, and almost every char type field in ACDOCC can be used as a version field. But in BPC side, there is only one dimension with the role "data category" has the similar usage. You should create a mapping between =BPC Category= to the S/4 version combinations. 

In this tab screen, you can add a new version by first assigning a unique =BPC Category= value, and then assign a value combination of =Consolidation Ledger=, =RTC Category=, and =Version=. The above three version fields are default assigned. In future release, you can define your own version fields combination as you like. Also, by default, the first line with =BPC Category= value with "Actual" is mandatory. You can just not delete it, and you must assign a valid value combination for it.  

**** Assignment Tab
#+Caption: Consolidation Model UI: Assignment
[[../image/ConsEnvDefinationUI_4.png]]

If BPC environment and model are not correctly set, you will only see 4 empty gray fields. Because these 4 fields: =Consolidation Entity=, =Partner Unit=, =Fiscal Year Variant=, and =Cons. Chart of Accounts= are derived from the corresponding settings in BPC's model(if you check "Integration with BPC"). Except =Partner Unit=, all other three are mandatory. If any of the three is missing, you can't activate the model.

**** Admin Tab
#+Caption: Consolidation Model UI: Admin
[[../image/ConsEnvDefinationUI_5.png]]  

=Admin= tab contains administrative data of the consolidation model. All these fields cannot be changed as it generates automatically along with other operations on the model. The last field =Current Active Version= indicates the version number of the model. It is used to check the consistency of the design time objects, and the consolidated data in ACDOCC.

** Design Details Documentation
*** Database Design
*** Data Flow & Design Time
Here describes how data is read, calculated, and write back during a consolidation. It is divided into 3 scenarios:
1. BPC read from ACDOCA, then write back to a cube/ADSO;
2. BPC read from union view of ACDOCA and ACDOCC, then write back to ACDOCC;
3. BPC read from ACDOCC, then write back to ACDOCC.

**** Read from ACDOCA, write to cube

*Currency is translated by BPC*. A =Flow= of "CT" is tagged to indicate the data is generated by currency translation.

**** Read from union view of ACDOCA and ACDOCC, write to ACDOCC
*Aggregated result of union view of ACDOCA and ACDOCC*. 

We must add =Model= and =Category= to the aggregated set, so that BPC can write back with these values into ACDOCC. The last field "SR" only used to indicate the data is coming from ACDOCA("A") or ACDOCC("C"). Actual data of "COMPA" is in ACDOCA, while actual data of "COMPB" is in ACDOCC. Fiscal period "2016003" stands for the current period data, and "2016002" means the result of last period which always comes from ACDOCC.
| Model  | Category | Group | Unit  | Account |  Fiscal | Amount | Currency | SR |
|--------+----------+-------+-------+---------+---------+--------+----------+----|
| M_COMP | Actual   | G1    | COMPA | 1000100 | 2016003 |    200 | USD      | A  |

| M_COMP | Actual   | G1    | COMPB | 1000200 | 2016002 |  18000 | CNY      | C  |

*Currency is translated by BPC*. 

Only generate lines from current period data. The last period data is only used for calculation reference, it won't be translated again.

*Write to ACDOCC*.

New fields are derived according to the mapping information in the model. 
1. =Ledger=, =RTC Category=, and =Version= are derived from =BPC Category=. 
2. =Doc Type= is derived from =Account=, =Audit=, =BPC Category=, and =Flow=. 
3. =Doc Number= is a sequential number get from a number interval which again is derived from =Doc Type=, =Ledger=, =RTC Category=, and =Version=. 
4. =DOCLN= stands for document line item number to indicate different line items of a document.
5. =BTTYPE= is always fixed to "BPC_CONS" if data comes from BPC.
6. =CoA= and =PERIV= are derived from model meta data.
| Model  | BPC Cate | Ledger | RTC Cate | Version | Doc Type | Doc Number | DOCLN | BTTYPE   | Group | Unit  | Account |  Fiscal | Amount | Currency | CoA | PERIV | Audit |

**** Read from ACDOCC, write to ACDOCC
Currency translation or simple elimination is done in S/4. Current period data is already processed and saved in ACDOCC, so there is no need to access ACDOCA again. 

*Get data from ACDOCC*. From period 000 to current period.

*Write to ACDOCC*.

New fields derivation is quite same with scenario 2. But in this case, as =BPC Category= is changed from "Actual" to "Plan", a lot of related fields are changed correspondingly. 
1. =Ledger=, =RTC Category=, and =Version= are changed to a new combination.
2. =Doc Type= is changed.
3. =Doc Number= is generated from a new number range interval.
