** Overall Design
*** Key Requirements and Design Goals
Data Modeling is the prerequisite for consolidation. It defines the views of  master data, customizing data, and transactional data that consolidation tasks are running on. 

A Consolidation Model defines the boundary for a kind of consolidation purposes which may share the same data structure, master data, consolidation logic, and other configurations. To be more specifically, modeling can be breakdown into following steps:
1. Define Currencies;
2. Define Consolidation Versions;
3. Financial Statement Items, and Consolidation Chart of Accounts(Hierarchy);
4. Subassigments and Breakdown Categories;
5. Consolidation Units and Groups;
6. Define Data Foundation Views and Consolidation Version;
7. Define Consolidation Methods, Document Types, and Consolidation Tasks;

**** Following Design Goals *MUST* be Met:
1. Fully take advantages of HANA and S/4 architecture;
2. Modeling artifacts can be consumed by BPC;
3. Performance must be guarantee for the generated modeling artifacts.

**** Following Design Goals *SHOULD* be Met:
1. Modeling tools should be intuitive and fulfill most of the consolidation requirements;
2. Modeling tools should provide error-proof features to avoid data inconsistency.

*** Context
As mentioned, Modeling is the prerequisite for consolidation. There are lots of master data, customizations, settings, and even system configurations should be prepared before consolidation tasks actually run.

It is a heavy task that could be done by different roles includes: system administrators for connectivities, consultants, developers, and accountants. But after consolidation model being perfectly set, consolidation tasks can be run smoothly and recursively.  

There are many terminologies and concepts emerging during modeling. Fortunately, we have good references from the existing consolidation solutions, like BCS, EC-CS, BPC, and FC; as well as G/L Accounting. However, they should be carefully picked up to Real-time Consolidation. We try to make Real-time Consolidation to be much simpler and straight forward. 
 
**** G/L Account or Financial Statement Item
RTC can use G/L Accounts to do consolidation, thus sharing the same set of account master data. All other 4 solutions have their own financial statement item master data set. So the existing solutions all choose to replicate accounts(or FS items), which has most the advantages in accounts mapping and conversion during replication. However, the first priority for RTC is to eliminate data replication, so RTC choose to create HANA views on no matter SKA1 or other tables, as long as the view fulfils a pre-defined protocal. 

**** Subitem and Subitem Category
Subitems mean =Sub Financial Statement Item=. They are used to further differentiate(breakdown) the values of a =Financial Statement Item=. 

For example, the financial statement for cash can have subitems of banks. It stands for the corp has multiple cash accounts of different banks. And in each bank, the subitem can be further breakdown by different currencies. The =Account Receivable= item can be breakdown by customers, then each customer number is a subitem. The advantage is saving namespaces of FS items, there is no need to create a FS item for each customer. 

=Subitem Category= is the total domain of subitems, or you can say a subitem contains a sub-domain of subitem category. Take sales region as an example, you can define a subitem with 3 regions of "Europe, Asia, Africa". The subitem is belong to the subitem category "Region" which may stand for all the sale regions on the earth. 

=Subitem= and =Subitem Category= together is called =Subassignment=. In BCS, only =Subassignment= is used. And multiple Subassigments can be grouped by =Breakdown Category=. 

**** Consolidation Chart of Account
Chart of Accounts is optional in BCS. Because you can use multiple hierarchies of account in an info-object. EC-CS has its own consolidation COA, but you can map cons COA to a G/L COA.

EC-CS COA is assigned with FS item hierarchies which contains has FS items represented in a hierarchy view. G/L COA has FSV instead. Table bellow describes the correspondences between EC-CS and G/L Accounting.

| *EC-CS*          | EC-CS COA | FS Item Hierarchy | FS Item | FS Item Set |
| *G/L Accounting* | G/L COA   | FSV               | Account | Account Set |

 Should verify if FS item hierarchy has something to do with SET and HRRP. 

**** Ledger
Ledger is only used in G/L Accounting and EC-CS. 

The G/L Accounting ledger groups journal entries. There are two types of ledger: *Standard Ledger* and *Extension Ledger*. Standard ledger contains a full set of journal entries for all business transaction. An extension ledger is assigned to a standard ledger and inherits all journal entries of the standard ledger for reporting. You should assign company codes to a ledger, and settings like Fiscal Year Variant and Currency Type are all company code based. 

In EC-CS, ledger is only used as a media to assign group currency key to a consolidation group. However, the assignment also depands on consolidation version. This means that you can assign different ledgers, and similary different consolidation group currencies, to a consolidation group in different consolidation versions. The field "RLDNR"(ledger) appears in both ECMCT and ECMCA, but is seems to be a redency infromation, as it can be determined through group and consolidation version. 

Does RTC need the ledger concept? It seems ledger is not such useful in all existing consolidation solutions. 

**** Accounting Principles
Accounting principles are the rules and guidelines that companies must follow when reporting financial data. The common set of U.S. accounting principles is the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Read more: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-principles.asp#ixzz4VtM9MFOF 

SAP G/L Accounting defines accounting principles to allow parallel accounting. You can assign each accounting priciple a ledger group, which can include multiple ledgers. You can find maintian Accounting Principles in the following IMG path: Financial Accounting(New)-->Ledgers-->Parallel Accounting.

**** Consolidation Version
In G/L Accounting, =Version= (field RVERS) is obsolete and remained only for the reason of compatibility. IBPF uses the combination of =Ledger= and =Category= for its version dimension. 

Read more: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/ERPFINDEV/SDD-Consolidation+Version

**** Flow or Transaction Type
BPC uses =Flow= to distinguish different journal items that are generated during different consolidation tasks. User then use the =Flow= dimension to filter the data he wants for different reporting purposes. 

In Accounting, we have =Document Type=, =Transaction Type=, and  =Business Transaction= to differentiate types of journal items that are generated by different components and different purposes.

In RTC, we use =Transaction Type= as the consolidation flow. 
 
**** Consolidation Unit/Dimension and Group 
BCS defines its cons unit by assigning ~Cons Unit~ role to info-objects, like: company, profit center, cost center, and so on. And cons group is an attribute of a cons unit info-object.

EC-CS has both maintenance views for cons unit and cons group. Additionally, EC-CS has the concept =Dimension=. The consolidation unit depends on the dimension in which it was created. This means that the master record you create for a consolidation unit exists only in that dimension.

Despite the different representation, the basic idea of cons unit and cons group are rather same. No mater it is in BCS or EC-CS. And Even BPC has very similar concepts. 

RTC use the Accounting org structure to represent consolidation unit. The group hierarchy is reusing BPC's.

**** Consolidation Area
Consolidation Area only appears in BCS. In BPC the similar concept is consolidation environment without completely match. Consolidation area is to define a subsets of characteristic fields and amount fields from data basis tables (like ACDOCA). Meanwhile, permanent values are defined for filtering and default values. 

Permanent values could include: Version, Fiscal Year, Period, and all possible fields you can define to boundary a consolidation campaign. 

Consolidation Methods and Tasks are also assigned to consolidation area.

In EC-CS, there is no such concept, instead it has =Global Parameter=. The global parameters includes dimension, Cons Unit/Group, Version, Fiscal Year, Period, and so on. These information can be accessed among all the consolidation tasks. The limitation is that EC-CS only allows single dimension consolidation, thus not such flexible as BCS.

For RTC, actually, consolidation model is much close the the consolidation area.

*** Major Building Blocks  
Modeling can contain many things, in this SDD, we only talk about master/customization data and schema(meta) definition for a consolidation. Other topics like system connectivity, data collection, and so on may exceed the area of consolidation itself.

The master/customization data maintenance is quite straight forward once all the concepts are clear and defined. The tool can either be auto-generated maintenance views, or specifically developed UIs and APIs for both manual and batch input. 

Schema definition or what we call =Data Modeling= can be the main development stuff. Tools are developed to allow users easily define the schema of their consolidation data. All the consolidation tasks are running on this data schema and producing consolidated results.

#+Caption: Data Modeling Design Time
[[../image/DataModelingDesignTime.png]]

The first step is to create a foundation view on ACDOCA(and other tables are also possible in future). The foundation view projects fields from ACDOCA (could join other tables), apply filters(where conditions), do field mappings and alignments. This can be achieved using HANA Calculation View Graphic Modeling Tool.

~User should ensure the performance of the foundation view, because almost all the consolidation tasks access data through it.~ 

The foundation view is then assigned to a consolidation model which is defined using RTC's modeling tool. You should also assign a group =Chart of Accounts=, a group =Fiscal Year Variant=, 2 =Data Categories=,and other default values. These information is used when generating consolidation views. 

It is necessary to define fields mapping between foundation view and consolidation journal table. Because,it is supposed that user can freely define their own source data and result table. The step is in a  dotted rectangles because currently only ACDOCA and ACDOCC will be involved. It is not necessary to do fields mapping, as these 2 tables share most of the pre-defined field names. 

Before generating consolidation views, there could be quite a lot of validations and checks. To make sure the views are correctly generated, there should be no less than following rules be checked before generating views:
1. If all mandatory fields are projected in the foundation view?
2. If the CoA, Fiscal Year Variant, and some other master data exists?
3. If all involved local accounts are mapped to group accounts?
4. If all involved company codes are mapped to companies? (For other dimension,like profit center, cost-center, there would be a mapping table planed).
5. If all fields defined in foundation view have counterparts in ACDOCC?

There are quite a lot of consolidation views generated automatically. These views are for different consolidation and validation tasks. In general, these views are categorized into 2 sets: HANA calculation views for BPC's consumption, and CDS views for RTC's own consumption. 
The BPC consolidation views will be union-ed under a composite provider, together with a virtual provider for write-back(The cons. result view is assigned to the virtual provider). User could still need to prepare info-objects(virtual or physical) for the dimensions in the composite provider. 

You can then open BPC modeling workbench to define BPC environment and model. After that, you switch back to RTC's modeling tool to assign the name of BPC environment and model. Finally you can check and activate the Real-time Consolidation Model. Besides the check rules before generating consolidation views, following additional rules will be checked before the activating:
1. If entity definition is consistent between RTC and BPC?
2. If CoA and Fiscal Variant definition are consistent between RTC and BPC?
3. If document types for BPC write-back is defined?
4. If BPC categories and consolidation versions are correctly mapped?
5. If other master data dimensions are consistent? ~In case using physical info-objects, there is no permit that the master data is consistent between BPC and S/4. In RTC's documentation, we should suggest user using virtual info-objects whenever possible.~

Only after successful activation can consolidation tasks be run. Or user cannot raise Data Release Requests. And BPC can not write-back any data.

Besides, there are also some configuration tasks like defining consolidation document types, defining selections, and defining currency translation methods. These tasks can be done after the activation of the consolidation model. 

**** Real-time Consolidation Modeling Tool(UI)                          :Sam:
The RTC Modeling Tool is used to define a Real-time Consolidation model object, and generate necessary consolidation views. It also permits the consistency of a consolidation context that run across S/4 and BPC. The RTC Modeling tool contains following parts:
1. *Cons. Views* defines the consolidation data views, and journal table to persist consolidation result.
2. *Integration* contains options and controls of how S/4 provides data to BPC, and how BPC write-back to S/4.
3. *Version* defines the version fields combinations, and the mapping between BPC category.
4. *Assignment* assigns FI objects like consolidation unit, partner unit, CoA, and Fiscal Year Variant.
5. *Admin* additional settings control how the consolidation model is used. 

For how to read BPC model's meta data, please refer the class: CL_RSBPCO_APPL_ADAPTER

**** Category, Ledger, and Variant Master Data Maintenance UI          :Lynn:
*Version* in consolidation means different copies of consolidated results for different purposes under a same consolidation area. So that although there are some differences among these versions, but they share most of the common master data and settings. For example, based on the same actual financial data, chart of accounts, and organizational structure, you can do consolidation for US GAAP, or IFRS.

But "Version" has a board meanings, for example, a program has multiple versions. Consolidation versions stand for a combination of different characteristic fields, like: Actual/GAAP/Legal, Plan/IFRS/Management. How many characteristic fields are involved to form a version combination can be freely defined by customers. There comes confusion between version-related fields and version itself. 

For example, the last field in the tab2 mock UI names ~Version~ too. But actually, it stands for the VERSN field in COEP. Add this field is only for the data integration with CO. The right 3 fields combination is called a consolidation version which is assigned with a version ID of 001. They all call ~version~ in different context. 

You develop a customization table for version ID definition. Refer EC-CS' table: TF200 and TF201. 

~There are still some uncertainties about BCS' version combination. Actually, version ID and version combination are 2 redundant information.~   

*Ledger* in consolidation is combined with =Accounting Principle=. You can just regard them as the same thing at concept level. So =Ledger= is also a version-related field used in version combination. You develop a customization table to allow user store different ledgers and ledger level settings. Each consolidation ledger can be mapped to multiple operational ledgers. 

*Category* is used to specify the consolidation purpose for, take an example, plan or actual. Try to reuse IBPF's existing category maintenance view: FCOMV_CATEGORY
 
Version is the most complicate configurations in consolidation. You can refer EC-CS and BCS to see how they realize the consolidation version. Regarding with RTC, in its initial release, we should only pick the essential parts of them. 

**** Foundation View                                            :Frank:Blang:
Foundation view is the main source of consolidation data, based on what consolidation tasks are run to produce consolidated results. 

In the initial releases, the source data is mainly coming from ACDOCA. You need to create a HANA calculation view on ACDOCA and do necessary fields projections and data filtering. ~The reason why using HANA calculation view not CDS view for the foundation view definition is because BPC only supports HANA calculation view. You can even not use HANA calculation view on CDS view.~

There are also mappings and derivations need to be done at foundation view level:
1. Operational Account --> Group Account
2. Dimension Fields Assignment, like: Company Code --> Company
3. Fiscal Year Period Alignment. [[http://help.sap.com/saphelp_470/helpdata/en/dc/f18b884efb11d39a350000e8a5999a/content.htm?frameset=/en/58/8e6a3c32853960e10000000a11402f/frameset.htm&current_toc=/en/5c/c1c25f445f11d189f00000e81ddfac/plain.htm&node_id=86][Check in KM]]

~We need an additional ABAP program to generate fiscal calendar data on day level. The program will take the fiscal year variant as input parameter, and then generates day level granularity fiscal calendar data into a specific table.~ 

Text fields should be avoided to join here. And field names should keep unchanged. The foundation CDS view should also avoid to use parameters as BPC can not consume parameterized calc views. 

**** Modeling Validation                                         :Steve:
As described above, modeling validation happens before consolidation view generation and model activation. There would be no less that than following rules should be checked:

*These rules are before consolidation views generation:*
1. If all mandatory fields are projected in the foundation view?
2. If the CoA, Fiscal Year Variant, and some other master data exist?
3. If all involved company codes are mapped to companies? (For other dimension,like profit center, cost-center, there would be a mapping table planed).
4. If all fields defined in foundation view have counterparts in ACDOCC?

*These rules are before model activation:*
1. If entity definition is consistent between RTC and BPC?
2. If CoA and Fiscal Variant definition are consistent between RTC and BPC?
3. If document types for BPC write-back is defined?
4. If all involved local accounts are mapped to group accounts?
5. If BPC categories and consolidation versions are correctly mapped?
6. If other master data dimensions are consistent? 

~In case using physical info-objects, there is no permit that the master data is consistent between BPC and S/4. In RTC's documentation, we should suggest user using virtual info-objects whenever possible.~

To achieve this, you should read the meta data of the HANA Calculation View. Need API information here.

You should reuse SAP application log (SLG0&SLG1) to show the check result. You can also refer ABAP class: ZCL_BG_LOG in S4H.

**** Generate Consolidation Views                                     :Steve:
#+Caption: Data Modeling Design Time
[[../image/ConsViews02.png]]

Consolidation views are generated based on the foundation view and ACDOCC. There are 2 branches for the generated views:
1. HANA Calculation views for the BPC consumption;
2. CDS views for the RTC consumption.

The reason to use 2 different DB view technologies is to harmonize the BW and the S/4HANA. The situation is that BW doesn't support CDS; And S/4HANA only supports CDS. As the 2 branches share the same foundation view, which is made by HANA calculation view. To consume HANA calculation view, the only supported approach is to use AMDP table function to access it. Then based on the table function, CDS views can be created.  

For generating CDS view, there are existing APIs to allow ABAP generates CDS views.

The demo ABAP program is: WB_DDLS_API_EXAMPLE_PROG

More details can be found in: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/TIPABAPVB/CDS+DDL+API+Description

The generated artifacts(HANA Calculation Views, CDS views, and AMDP methods) are not transported. Only model data can be transported from DEV to QA, and PRD systems. It is at the target systems these artifacts can be regereated in local namespaces.

**** +Selection on Accounts+                                      :Vincent:
*This part is deprecated as a better solution is provided!* See [[https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/ERPFINDEV/SDD-Consolidation+Views#SDD-ConsolidationViews-4.4FSItemsMappingView][FS Item Mapping View]].

Not all the operational accounts need to be involved in a consolidation. There should be a place to allow user to define which operational account numbers should be involved in certain chart of accounts. 

This can be achieved using the general object: =Selection=. A special composite selection is reserved with the name "SELECTION001". Under the composite selection, user can add multiple single selections to compile his accounts selection.

When generate consolidation views in the RTC Modeling Tool, the above selection will be added into all the views. Then only the choose accounts is filtered in. 
  
**** +Field Projection and Role Assignment+
*This section is Frozen!*

Fields are projected from data foundation tables, like ACDOCA or ACDOCC. These fields are categorized into certain groups. Some groups are mandatory for consolidation, and even the number of fields is fixed. Based on existing knowledge from BCS and EC-CS, I category fields into following groups:

#+Caption: Field Projection & Role Assignment
[[../image/FieldRoleAssignment.png]]

User first assigns a foundation table/view, then the above screen is pop up to let user project fields, assigned roles, and set permanent parameters. Only certain groups are allowed to set permanent parameters, these parameters will be represented as ~where~ and ~group~ statement during CDS view generation.

Some groups are mandatory, for example ~Consolidation Unit/Dimension~, you must at least assign one field (at maximum two) for this group of fields. ~Financial Statement Item~ is also mandatory. 

This UI representation of field projection and role assignment is tailored to ACDOCA table. It should be flexible enough for other tables. So templates will be designed which allow user to using exist settings. For example, template for ACDOCA should already have some field assigned for those  mandatory field groups. User can also extend the view and save as their own templates.

*** Design Challenges resulting from Non-Functional Requirements                       
Generate both HANA calculation views and CDS views.

** Detail Design
*** RTC Modeling Tool UI
Real-time Consolidation Modeling Tool is used to generate consolidation views used for various consolidation tasks. 
**** Initial Screen & Basic Settings
#+Caption: RTC Modeling Tool: Basic Settings
[[../image/RTCModelingToolUI01.png]]

You can create a consolidation model in the initial screen by entering a model name (6 characters long). Existing check and lock check will be made to make sure the model name is available. You can also display or change an existing model. A model cannot be deleted once it is activated, but it can be de-activated to forbid use. You can also do checks on a model to make sure all the settings are consistent. The check results will be shown in a pop up dialog.

You must assign:
1. A *Consolidation Dimension* is to determine which field or fields combination is defined as the consolidation entity and partner entity. 
2. A *Consolidation Chart of Accounts* is used to present the group financial statements. 
3. A *Consolidation Fiscal Year Variant* is used to distribute journal entries into the right group fiscal year period.

In the "Integration Option", you set whether the model integrates with BPC. If yes, you have to give a "Default Flow Type" which is actually a transaction type. This is because transaction type in ACDOCA is mapped to BPC's flow dimension, and BPC requires every row have a flow type. In case lines in ACDOCA do not have the transaction type, then the default one is used.

You can also decide which currency translation mode you prefer. 
1. CT in RTC;
2. CT in G/L Accounting with Revaluation;
3. CT in G/L Accounting w/o Revaluation, using RTC CT method to do the revaluation at month-end;
4. CT in BPC.

The integration options controls how the consolidation views are generated.  
 
**** Data Source 
#+Caption: Real-time Consolidation Modeling Tool: Data Source
[[../image/RTCModelingToolUI02.png]]

You define consolidation data sources in this tab. Consolidation data sources are grouped by *Data Category*. Each data category contains a full set of source data for consolidation. Different types of source data are further differentiated using *Data Stream*. You assign each data stream a HANA view (either CDS or Calculation view) which is protocolized. Data streams and their protocols are pre-defined.

The data stream "FI Journal" and "FS Item" are 2 mandatory stream types. Others are optional. If the model is set to integrate with BPC, then you have to assign HANA calculation views to this stream type, CDS view is not allowed. This is also known as the foundation view.

~You must first enter the HANA package where the foundation view resides. To be in mind, the HANA DB user "SAP<SID>" must have the read/write access to the HANA package of FI Journal. As later on, it will generate HANA Calculation views into the same package.~ 

The data category can be added from existing templates. SAP delivers following 2 templates:
| <10>       |                       |
| Data Category Template | Description           |
|------------+-----------------------|
| Actual     | Actual data in ACDOCA |
| Plan       | Plan data in ACDOCP   |

| <10>       |                 |               |                  |                   |
| Data Category Template | Data Stream     | CDS View      | Hana Package     | Calc View         |
|------------+-----------------+---------------+------------------+-------------------|

**** Consolidation Version
Version is used to execute parallel consolidations according to different aspects. You can define multiple versions for a consolidation model. The consolidation result then will be isolated by by versions. Each version is defined as a combination of 3 version related fields: =Data Category=, =Account Principle=, and =Variant=. But in BPC side, there is only one dimension with the role "data category" has the similar usage. You have to create a mapping between =BPC Category= to the S/4 version combination if you model needs to integrate with BPC. 

#+Caption: Real-time Consolidation Modeling Tool: Version
[[../image/RTCModelingToolUI03.png]]

In this tab screen, you can create a consolidation version, which you just assign a unique value combination of =Data Category=, =Account Principle=, and =Variant=. In the scenario with BPC, you must also map a BPC Category to one of your version combinations. 

It is recommended you have 2 BPC categories created: "FINAL" and "PRELIM" if integrates with BPC. And the version related value combination is also automatically generated in this way:
| BPC Category | Data Category | Acct. Principle | Variant |
|--------------+---------------+-----------------+---------|
| FINAL        | Actual        |                 |     100 |
| PRELIM       | Actual        |                 |     200 |
In BPC scenario, the data category "Actual" is also automatically created, so do the variant 100 and 200. The Account Principle field is optional, you can leave it empty.  

When you click the "Add", a pop-up dialog will allow you to add a new version. You give an unique BPC category. If it doesn't exist, it will create one.

~The master head table for BPC category is FCOMC_CATEGORY which belongs to the IBPF team. We share the category master data for future planning and consolidation integration. If you add a new BPC category, it will insert a new entry into table FCOMC_CATEGORY.~

**** Consolidation View 
Consolidation views are CDS views and HANA calculation views genereated by the modeling tool based on the foundation views and other meta definitions, like, Chart of Account, Fiscal Year Variant, consolidation dimension, and so on.

#+Caption: Real-time Consolidation Modeling Tool: Consolidation Views
[[../image/RTCModelingToolUI04.png]]

Consolidation views are generated either by clicking the ~Generate~ button, or along with the activation. Consolidation views are grouped by usages, for example, base view, BPC view, Validation View, and so on. The usages and their consolidaton views are predefined by SAP. Which usages and views will be generated dynamically depends on the integration options. For example, if you don't check the "Integration with BPC", then the BPC view usage and its views are not genereated and shown.

The trafic light icon before each view or group indicates the status of the view:
+ Green: Every thing is OK;
+ Yellow: The view exists, however, need re-generation;
+ Red: The view doesn't exist.

You can switch between "Normal View" or "Expert View" by clicking the button ~Normal/Expert View~ button. In the "Normal View", only the most useful views are shown; while in "Expert View", all the generated views are shown. The default is "Normal View" to eliminate complication.  

Read the SDD [[https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/ERPFINDEV/SDD-Consolidation+Views][Consolidation Views]] for details.

**** BPC Integration
#+Caption: Real-time Consolidation Modeling Tool: BPC Integration
[[../image/RTCModelingToolUI05.png]]

The =BPC Integration= tab is only shown if you choose the "Integration with BPC" option. In this tabstrip, you must give a BPC consolidation environment and a BPC model name, or the model is not allowed to be activated. During activation, the BPC model is checked to see if it is compatiable with the current RTC model. If not, error logs are given in the "Modeling Validation Log". Bearing in mind, each BPC environment and model combination must not be used in more than one models. 

~BPC has exposed an interface to allow you read model meta data: CL_RSBPCO_APPL_ADAPTER.~

**** Admin Tab
#+Caption: Real-time Consolidation Modeling Tool: Admin
[[../image/RTCModelingToolUI06.png]]

=Admin= tab contains administrative data of the consolidation model. All these fields cannot be changed as it generates automatically along with other operations on the model. The last field =Current Active Version= indicates the version number of the model. It is used to check the consistency of the design time objects, and the consolidated data in ACDOCC. 

**** Modeling Validation Log
#+Caption: Real-time Consolidation Modeling Tool: Validation Log
[[../image/RTCModelingToolUI90.png]]

Before generating views or activating from the model definition, validation should be done to make sure the model definition is consistent. The validation result will be output as application log which is shown in a dialog box. 
Following criterias must be fulfilled before generating consolidation views:
1. Consolidation Dimension exists;
2. Consolidation Chart of Accounts exists;
3. Fiscal Year Variant exist;
4. Default Flow Type exists;
6. You must at least add one data category so that foundation views can be assigned.;
7. A foundation view must be assigned to the stream type "FI Journals";
8. The foundation view comply with the protocol of "FI Journals";
9. If other stream types are assigned with CDS views, they must also comply with the corresponding protocol;
10. The foundation view must contain all the fields defined in the consolidation dimension;
11. You must at least create one consolidation version;
12. A consolidation version must at least has a data category and a variant, Accounting Principle can be optional, however, each combination must be unique;
13. If the model is BPC integrated, a BPC category must be mapped to a consolidation version;

Following criterias must be additionally fulfilled before activating the model:
1. You must assign a BPC environment and model to the RTC model;
2. The assigned BPC environment and model must not be assigned to other RTC model;
3. The settings between the BPC model and RTC model must be consistent, however, if the model is created using BPC integrated web client, the consistency is already permitted;
4. The posting API exists;
5. The global temporary table of ACDOCC exists;
6. The default number range interval '00' of RTCJOURN exists;

When activating the model, besides generating consolidation views, there are default document types and BRF+ Application generated.
 
*** TODO Database Design                       
*** Data Flow & Design Time
Here describes how data is read, calculated, and write back during a consolidation. It is divided into 3 scenarios:
1. BPC read from ACDOCA, then write back to a cube/ADSO;
2. BPC read from union view of ACDOCA and ACDOCC, then write back to ACDOCC;
3. BPC read from ACDOCC, then write back to ACDOCC.
   
**** Read from ACDOCA, write to cube

**** Read from union view of ACDOCA and ACDOCC, write to ACDOCC
*Aggregated result of union view of ACDOCA and ACDOCC*. 

We must add =Model= and =Category= to the aggregated set, so that BPC can write back with these values into ACDOCC. The last field "SR" only used to indicate the data is coming from ACDOCA("A") or ACDOCC("C"). Actual data of "COMPA" is in ACDOCA, while actual data of "COMPB" is in ACDOCC. Fiscal period "2016003" stands for the current period data, and "2016002" means the result of last period which always comes from ACDOCC.

*Write to ACDOCC*.

New fields are derived according to the mapping information in the model. 
1. =Ledger=, =RTC Category=, and =Version= are derived from =BPC Category=. 
2. =Doc Type= is derived from =Account=, =Audit=, =BPC Category=, and =Flow=. 
3. =Doc Number= is a sequential number get from a number interval which again is derived from =Doc Type=, =Ledger=, =RTC Category=, and =Version=. 
4. =DOCLN= stands for document line item number to indicate different line items of a document.
5. =BTTYPE= is always fixed to "BPC_CONS" if data comes from BPC.
6. =CoA= and =PERIV= are derived from model meta data.

New fields derivation is quite same with scenario 2. But in this case, as =BPC Category= is changed from "Actual" to "Plan", a lot of related fields are changed correspondingly. 
1. =Ledger=, =RTC Category=, and =Version= are changed to a new combination.
2. =Doc Type= is changed.
3. =Doc Number= is generated from a new number range interval.

** Modeling Process Deduce
*** Add a consolidation ledger
#+CAPTION: RTC_LEDGER
| Cons Ledger | Description            |
|-------------+------------------------|
| C1          | Consolidation Ledger 1 |
| C2          | Consolidation Ledger 2 |

*** Assign consolidation ledger to account principle
#+CAPTION: RTC_ACCTP
| Acct. P | Cons Ledger |
|---------+-------------|
| GAAP    | C1          |
| GAAP    | C2          |

*** Define a consolidation model
Consolidation model "VINCE1" is created based on foundation view "C_FOUNDATION_VIEW". Two consolidation versions are defined:
| Cons Ledger | Data Category | Variant |
|-------------+---------------+---------|
| C1          | Actual        |     100 |
| C2          | Plan          |     200 |

*** Generate consolidation views
*Version independent logic:*
1. Join C_FOUNDATION_VIEW with SKA1 for mapping operational CoA to group  CoA;
2. Join C_FOUNDATION_VIEW with FISCAL_TIME for aligning operational FYV to group FYV;
3. Join C_FOUNDATION_VIEW with RTC_ENTITY for mapping financial org to consolidation entity;

*Version dependent logic:*
1. Join C_FOUNDATION_VIEW with RTC_LEDGER_ASGNMT to get all local data;
2. Fix values for columns "Ledger", "Data Category" and "Variant";
3. Join RTC_DRR for timestamp filtering on perivous periods;
4. Union ACDOCC for the version related data;

base view 
**** Conclusion
*It is impossible for the runtime dynamic filtering on consolidation ledgers. We have to genreate consolidation views in design time for each consolidaiton version.* 

*** Flexible Upload
You have to provide consolidation ledger when upload the local report data. Or the data cannot be correctly unioned with ACDOCA. 
| Model  | Cons Ledger | Data Category | Variant |  Period | Entity | Amount | Curr |
|--------+-------------+---------------+---------+---------+--------+--------+------|
| VINCE1 | C1          | Actual        |     100 | 2016008 | C1001  |    100 | CNY  |

Now suppose I have another version defined:
| Cons Ledger | Data Category | Variant |
|-------------+---------------+---------|
| C1          | Actual        |     100 |
| C1          | Simulate      |     100 |
| C2          | Plan          |     200 |
If I want to re-use the flexible upload data, then I have to leave the "Data Category" empty, and filtering data only use "Cons Ledger". And I also think "Variant" is redundancy, we can just add an attribute on Data Category to indicate whether it needs data release controls. 
| Model  | Cons Ledger | Data Category |  Period | Entity | Amount | Curr |
|--------+-------------+---------------+---------+--------+--------+------|
| VINCE1 | C1          |               | 2016008 | C1001  |    100 | CNY  |

When you run CT, journal entiry will be generated for each "Cons Ledger" and "Data Category":
| Model  | Cons Ledger | Data Category |  Period | Entity | Amount | Curr |
|--------+-------------+---------------+---------+--------+--------+------|
| VINCE1 | C1          |               | 2016008 | C1001  |    100 | CNY  |
| VINCE1 | C1          | Actual        | 2016008 | C1001  |    200 | USD  |
| VINCE1 | C1          | Simulate      | 2016008 | C1001  |    300 | USD  |
Then local amount is shared by both Actual and Simulate category

*** Additional Financial Data
You have to assign a consolidation ledger for each additional financial data set. 
| Model  | Cons Ledger |  Period | Investor | Investee | Amount |
|--------+-------------+---------+----------+----------+--------|
| VINCE1 | C1          | 2016008 | C1001    | C1002    |    100 |
Then both "Actual" and  "Simulate" share the same set of AFD.

*** Consolidation Method Assignment
To achieve consolidation method resue, you have add each entity-method assignment with data category. 
| Model  | Data Category | Entity | Method |
|--------+---------------+--------+--------|
| VINCE1 | Actual        | C1001  | CTM01  |
| VINCE1 | Actual        | C1002  | CTM02  |
| VINCE1 | Simulate      | C1001  | CTM03  |
| VINCE1 | Simulate      | C1002  | CTM03  |
You can not add consolidation ledger to these assignments, as it some how indicates data sources. And if you combine consolidation logic with data, then reuse cannot achieveable. 

*** Exchange Rate Indicator
Exchange Rate Indicator should also be maintained under Data Category. You can achieve different Exchange Rate Types in different Data Categories. For example:
| Model  | D.Cate   | ERI | Type |
|--------+----------+-----+------|
| VINCE1 | Actual   |   1 | 1001 |
| VINCE1 | Actual   |   2 | 1002 |
| VINCE1 | Actual   |   3 | 1003 |
| VINCE1 | Simulate |   1 | 2001 |
| VINCE1 | Simulate |   2 | 2002 |
| VINCE1 | Simulate |   3 | 2003 |

*** Conclusion
1. Somehow the above deduction works;
2. Version field "Variant" is not necessary. Keeping it will add complexity in consolidation view generation and add confusion;
3. User has to maintain an additional mapping table for the consoldiation ledger to accounting ledger + company code. If the source data set consists of multiple ledgers, he has to maintain all the mappings. If the assignments are changed in the mapping table, then data inconsistency will happen;
4. You must have "ledger" and "company code" in the foundation view, even if your consolidation dimension is built upon others, like segment, cost center, and so on.
5. If you want union other data sources(for example: ACDOCP) in the foundation view, you have to make sure the leger mapping is correctly defined. If you want ACDOCP with ledger '2E', however you also want ACDOCA with ledger '0L'+'1E', then you have to maintain all the mappings to the 3 ledgers. If '2E' happens to be used in ACDOCA, then it is very hard to coordinate.
6. With "Ledger"+"Data Category", you can only achieve reported data re-use, you can not re-use the consolidated data in ACDOCC. For example, if you want release the translated data to group level, then you have to run CT for each consolidation version even the source data and tranlation logic are the same.
