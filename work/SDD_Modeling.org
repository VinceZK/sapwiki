As EC-CS already has data container ECMCA & EMMCT. Modeling tasks could include defination of: Dimension, Cons Unit, Cons Group, Cons Chart of Account, Subassigment, Version, and Ledger. |

** Design
*** Key Requirements and Design Goals

**** Following Design Goals *MUST* be Met:
   
**** Following Design Goals *SHOULD* be Met:

*** Context

*** Major Building Blocks  
**** Version
Reuse BCS or EC-CS?

**** Ledger
Reuse accounting ledger or EC-CS ledger? It seems BCS doesn't have ledger concept.

**** Consolidation Chart of Account
Chart of accounts is optional in BCS. Because you can use multiple hierarchy of account in info-object.

EC-CS has its own consolidation COA which is different with G/L COA. But you can map cons COA to a G/L COA.

EC-CS COA is assigned with FS item hierarchies, which afterwards has FS items assigned. Should verify if FS item hierarchy has something to do with SET. 

**** Financial Statement Item
Does RTC use FS Item or G/L Account?

**** Consolidation Unit/Dimension and Group 
BCS defines its cons unit by assigning ~Cons Unit~ role to info-objects, like: company, profit center, cost center, and so on. And cons group is an attribute of a cons unit info-object.

EC-CS has both maintanence views for cons unit and cons group. Additionally, EC-CS has the concept =Dimension=. The consolidation unit depends on the dimension in which it was created. This means that the master record you create for a consolidation unit exists only in that dimension.

Despite the different represntation, the basic idea of cons unit and cons group are rather same. No mater it is in BCS or EC-CS. And Even BPC has very similar concepts. 

RTC may reuse the tables and maintanence views of EC-CS to define its own =Unit & Group=. Then try to map and synchronize them to the correponding objects in BPC.

**** Consolidation Area
Define a subsets of characteristic fields and amount fields from ACDOCA & ACDOCC. Meanwhile, fix values are defined when filtering and saving. 

Fixed values includes: the version, the fiscal year, the period, and all possible fields you can define.

Consolidation Tasks are also assigned to consolidation area.
