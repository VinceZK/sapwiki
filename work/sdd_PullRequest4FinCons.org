#+TITLE: SDD-Pull Request for Consolidation

* Context
Local accountants can raise a =pull request= to submit financial reported data. A "Pull Request" contains timestamp and other filtering information to boundary an data area in ACDOCA/C so that group accountants can correctly pull the data to do validations and consolidations. 

Pull requests can be generated recurrently or occasionally. The former is auto-generated by defining a recurrence schedule. The latter is for on occasionally re-open a period to posting additional documents. 

* Recurrence Pull Request
#+CAPTION: Recurrence Pull Request

Assume a recurrence automatically consolidation process is defined. A consolidation process contains multiple sub-processes which runs monthly. To be simple, we only involve 2 roles: Local accountant who does his tasks in a local financial system; Group accountant who run her consolidation tasks in the central system. Following tasks are executed in a chronography order:
1. The central system automatically raise the group period close request to the local system.
2. Local accountant gets the notification and close the period based on group fiscal year variant. A regular pull request is initiated and sent to the group accountant. A pull request contains the timestamp on when the "period close" happens, and other additional filtering on company code, ledger, posting date, and so on.
3. Group accountant gets the pull request notification for the specific local company. She opens it to check the actual data and runs reported data validations on it. If she thinks the data in the request is OK, she then accepts it. The consolidation system will pull the corresponding data described in the pull request. It will also update the "time marker" property of the local entity with the timestamp in the pull request. 
4. If group accountant thinks the data is not ready, she rejects the pull request. The pull request is then statued as "de-active".
5. Once the local accountant receives the rejected notification, he must do adjustments to fulfill the requirements raise by the group accountant. So he opens the group period and do adjustments and validations. Then he closes the group period again to forbid unwanted postings in this period. A pull request is raised along with his close activity which again contains the timestamp on when the close is happening.The interval between this timestamp and the last accepted pull request's timestamp is exactly the data the group accountant wants for this period.
6. Again the group accountant will receive the new pull request, and the same steps are executed recursively.

* Occasional Pull Request
#+CAPTION: Occasional Pull Request
[[../image/OccasionalPullRequest4FinCons.png]]  

Occasional pull requests share exactly the same logic as the recurrence approach. There is actually no difference on the technique point of view. The difference form business point of view is that the group accountant has one more option "defer" to deal with them. Detail processes are explained bellow:
1. When the local accountant decides to re-open the period, he must close it again after additional documents are posted in this period which will then raise a pull request automatically.
2. The pull request is notified and got by the group accountant, she decides whether it should be included in this consolidation run, or be deferred in next run. Of course, she can also reject it if she thinks it is a minor change.
3. If "include" is chosen, then the consolidation system pull the data according to the pull request. A delta run is the first choice, but if impossible, then a full run of this period is taken. The pull request is then flagged as "processed", and all the un-processed pull requests before it will be disgarded. Meanwhile, the timestamp of the successfully processed pull request will be put on to the entity's "time marker" field. 
4. If "defer" is chosen, then the consolidation system will save the status for the pull request. The next time consolidation is run, the data in the pull request will be processed and consolidated into the next period. But user can still trace back to know that this data is belong to the previous period, although it is counted in this period. 
5. If "reject" is chosen, which means the data contains incompliance, the local accountant will then receive the notification, but this time, he can decide if a resubmit is necessary or not. 

As said before, once a pull request is processed, then all the unprocessed ones before it will be disgarded. Combined with recurrence run, as it requires each occurence the local accountant must submit his local financial data, which means there will be no pull request could be deferred to *next next* occurence. 

It is also very usuall that the local accountant opens the periods and never closes them. As no pull request is raised, the group accountant can not pull the new data afterwards. But she can be informed, so that external process could be taken. Then, when the local accountant close those opened periods, each period should generate a pull request which points the documents only belongs to that period. All those pull requests will be included in the upcoming occurence. 

* Comparison with On-the-Fly
The pull request approach is built on the conclusion that local accountants have the right to decide when and which data should be reported to the group accountants. If no pull request is raised by local accountants, then the group accountant is not allowed to pull the data from local company, even technically, the data is already in the central system. 

The pull request is conflict with the on-the-fly consolidation cases. As on-the-fly means it always reads the latest data in the central system. Group accountants access the local data without local accountants' permission. 

* DB Design for Pull Request
The tables holds the pull request resides in the central system. Each time, the local system raises a pull request, it will be synchoronized to the central system. Of course, the local system should also save a copy of the pull request. We can use 2 tables to describe a pull request:
1. Pull request head table which contains the head information like the timestamp when the period is closed.
2. Pull request boundary item table which contains the filtering conditions to boundary the data in ACDOCA.

* Pull Request Process UI
Once the group accountant gets the pull request notification in BPC's consolidation monitor, she clicks it and a dialog window will pop-up which shows the data in the pull request. She can then decides how to process the pull request.  

The dialog window is realized using an ABAP ALV report (The best way is to use BPC's UI5 framework), it show the data contains in the pull request. And there are also some buttons, like: Validate, Reject, Approve, Defer, and so on. So that she can easliy handle the pull request. 

* Group Level Lock/Unlock Posting Period Request
The local system synchoronizes its FI documents into the central system, BPC access the data in the central system. The lock/unlock a period means both lock/unlock in the local system and the central system. Because although in most cases, documents are posted in the local system,  it is still possible to have documents directly posted in the central system. 

According to different corporation contexts, there could be 3 different senarios regarding with who is the initiator for the Lock/Unlock request, the local accountant or group accountant?

** Lock is Requested by Group Accountant 

[[../image/GroupLevelPeriodLock01.png]]  

In this case, the group accountant can raise a posting period lock request directly in BPC's consolidastion monitor. The lock request is saved in the central system, and send to the local system. Based on configuration, the local system can either do the lock automatically(which means the group accountant has the full authority to do period lock/unlock); Or send a notification to the local accountant, so that he can decide whether to do the Lock.

Once the group level posting period is locked in the lock system, it will also lock the counterpart in the central system. Because in central system, the account numbers may not be the same with those in the local system, necessary mapping should be done. Meanwhile, a pull request will be raised which includes all the changes(new documents line items) belong to this interval. The pull request is saved in central system, and the group accountant will be notified and do the data pulling.   

** Local Accountant Does the Lock

[[../image/GroupLevelPeriodLock02.png]]  

This case, the local accountant has the authority to do group level lock/unlok. The group accountant is only be notified that there is a new pull request should be processed.  

** Local Accountant Request for Unlock 

[[../image/GroupLevelPeriodLock03.png]]  

If group accountant has the full authority to do group level lock/unlock, then the local accountant  must raise a unlock request if he wants to do posting in a closed period. The unlock request is saved in the central system, and the group accountant decides whether to approve or reject it. The the unlock request gets approved, it will unlock the period both in the central system and the local system. 

** Mapping Group Lock/Unlock to Lock Open/Close Posting Period
In either of the above 3 senarios, mappings are needed as the account numbers and fiscal year variant are are different among BPC, central system, and local system. Each time a lock/unlock request, or a pull request is raised, the local finacial master data should be correctly mapped to the central ones and the group ones, and vice verse. 

These mapping activites could be complicate. Take fiscal year variant as an example, which could be different between group and local. From the consolidation perspective, the lock/unlock period always means according to the group fiscal variant. But to the local accountant, he may cares more on open/close fiscal year/period based on local fiscal variant. It's involuntary to think to combine local open/close with group lock/unlock. So that no additional effort is introduced to the local accountants. But these attempts would introduce more complexity than simplification.

#+CAPTION: Existing Open and Close Posting Periods Maintenance View 
[[../image/OpenClosePeriodMaintView.png]]  

Above snapshot is taken from the IMG maintenance view for current open/close posting periods. The underlying table is ~T001B~, with the Tcode ~FAGL_EHP4_T001B_COFI~.  If you want to leverage this maintenance view to realize group level posting lock/unlock, you must convert the group fiscal year variant and account numbers into local ones before inserting items into this table. Besides, you should also determine:
1. Which open posting variant(first column in above table) should be used.
2. Which account type should be used.
3. If I close a period, do I have to delete a line and then add a new correct line, or I should modify an existing line?
