#+TITLE: SDD-Pull Request for Consolidation

* Context
Local accountants can raise a =pull request= to submit financial reported data. A "Pull Request" contains timestamp and other filtering information to boundary an data area in ACDOCA/C so that group accountants can correctly pull the data to do validations and consolidations. 

Pull requests can be generated recurrently or occasionally. The former is auto-generated by defining a recurrence schedule. The latter is for on occasionally re-open a period to posting additional documents. 

* Recurrence Pull Request

Assume a recurrence automatically consolidation process is defined. A consolidation process contains multiple sub-processes which runs monthly. To be simple, we only involve 2 roles: Local accountant who does his tasks in a local financial system; Group accountant who run her consolidation tasks in the central system. Following tasks are executed in a chronography order:
1. The central system automatically raise the group period close request to the local system.
2. Local accountant gets the notification and close the period based on group fiscal year variant. A regular pull request is initiated and sent to the group accountant. A pull request contains the timestamp on when the "period close" happens, and other additional filtering on company code, ledger, posting date, and so on.
3. Group accountant gets the pull request notification for the specific local company. She opens it to check the actual data and runs reported data validations on it. If she thinks the data in the request is OK, she then accepts it. The consolidation system will pull the corresponding data described in the pull request. It will also update the "time marker" property of the local entity with the timestamp in the pull request. 
4. If group accountant thinks the data is not ready, she rejects the pull request. The pull request is then statued as "de-active".
5. Once the local accountant receives the rejected notification, he must do adjustments to fulfill the requirements raise by the group accountant. So he opens the group period and do adjustments and validations. Then he closes the group period again to forbid unwanted postings in this period. A pull request is raised along with his close activity which again contains the timestamp on when the close is happening.The interval between this timestamp and the last accepted pull request's timestamp is exactly the data the group accountant wants for this period.
6. Again the group accountant will receive the new pull request, and the same steps are executed recursively.

* Occasional Pull Request

Occasional pull requests share exactly the same logic as the recurrence approach. There is actually no difference on the technique point of view. The difference form business point of view is that the group accountant has one more option "defer" to deal with them. Detail processes are explained bellow:
1. When the local accountant decides to re-open the period, he must close it again after additional documents are posted in this period which will then raise a pull request automatically.
2. The pull request is notified and got by the group accountant, she decides whether it should be included in this consolidation run, or be deferred in next run. Of course, she can also reject it if she thinks it is a minor change.
3. If "include" is chosen, then the consolidation system pull the data according to the pull request. A delta run is the first choice, but if impossible, then a full run of this period is taken. The pull request is then flagged as "processed", and all the un-processed pull requests before it will be ignored and statued as "de-active". Meanwhile, the timestamp of the successfully processed pull request will be put on to the entity's "time marker" field. 
4. If "defer" is chosen, then the consolidation system will save the status for the pull request. The next time consolidation is run, the data in the pull request will be processed and consolidated into the next period. But user can still trace back to know that this data is belong to the previous period, although it is counted in this period. 
5. If "reject" is chosen, the local accountant will receive the notification, but this time, he can decide if a resubmit is needed or not. 

The status change of pull requests that belongs to a same local company could have dependency. For example, if there is already a pull request flagged as "defer", then the upcoming pull requests can not be "reject". The group accountant should either choose to defer them again which will de-active the former deferred one; or choose to include them in this run which will then discard the former deferred one too. 

* Other Considerations
The pull request approach is built on the conclusion that local accountants have the right to decide when and which data should be reported to the group accountants. If no pull request is raised by local accountant, then the group accountant is not allowed to pull the data from local company, even technically, the data is already in the central system. 

The pull request is conflict with the on-the-fly consolidation cases. As on-the-fly means it always reads the latest data in the central system. Group accountants access the local data without local accountants' permission.
