** Design
*** Context
A consolidation campaign can be divided as the execution sequence of a bunch of consolidation tasks. Each consolidation task is assigned with a consolidation method which has multiple steps. Steps can either be run sequentially or parallely. A step can be genaricly defined as follows:
1. Do selections on the data
2. Do aggregations, translations, and comparisions
3. Post the difference to an account object

Take currency translation as an example. You define a currency translation method that contains multiple translation entries which are corresponding to steps that can be executed parallely. You define a translation entry like this:
1. A selection on FS items and their subitems. A source currency amount field and the target amount field are also choosen as the calculation scalar. 
2. A translation key and rate indicator which are used to determine translation logic and using which exchange rate(or coeffiency in mathmetics).
3. Differential items(and subitems) to record difference if it has.

To be more abstract, a step is a function that has a defined set as an input, and an output of a result set to be persisted. Based on this idea, we can design a method framework that can cover all the consolidation use cases. The benfits are:
1. A unified development pattern
2. A unified method invoke machanism for the future consolidation monitor and task framework.
3. A more genaric method for rule-based consolidation.
