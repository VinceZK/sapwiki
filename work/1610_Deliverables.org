#+TODO: TODO | OPEN DONE

DONE: Development is almost done, testing is in the process
TODO: Development is not started yet.
OPEN: Development is continuing. 
[#A]: First Pirority
[#B]: Second Pirority
[#C]: Third Pirority

* Consolidation Model
Deliverables related to consolidation modeling, define consolidation views, and master data maintenance.
** DONE [#B] Foundation View
A HANA calculation view which is used to project fields from ACDOCA and do basic joins and data filtering.

An example is delivered =RTC_C_FOUNDATIONVIEW=

** TODO [#C] Accounts View
A HANA calculation view based on SKA1 which is used to do operational accounts filtering and mapping to group consolidation accounts. 

The view can be regenerated based on the =$SELECTION001=. 

** DONE [#B] Fiscal Year/Period alignment view
A HANA calculation view based on table XXXX. Data in that table is generated by program =FINS_GENERATE_FISCAL_PERIOD=, and it is to day-level granularity. The view joins ACDOCA on document posting date(BUDAT), thus the fiscal year/period can be aligned according to any fiscal year variant. 

** DONE [#B] Version Related Fields 
3 version related fields and their maintenance view
1. RTC Data Category
2. Consolidation Ledger
3. Variant

** OPEN [#A] Consolidation Modeling Tool
An ABAP application which is used to define consolidation model meta and generate the needed consolidation views based on foundation view. 

The Tcode is =RTCMD=. Still under test.

** DONE [#A] Consolidation Document Type Customizing
Consolidation document type teaches how consolidation journals are posted to ACDOCC. 

The Tcode is =RTCDT=.

* Currency Translation
Deliverables related to currency translation in S/4HANA.
** DONE [#A] Currency Translation Method Customization and Generalization
An ABAP application that is used to define a currency translation method which contains translation entries and rounding entries. Each translation entry contains an exchange rate type, a selection, a translation algorithm, and differential items to record translation difference.

After activation, the application will generate AMDP methods as the runtime artifacts. All the currency translation logic is pushed down to HANA to achieve the best performance benefits. 

The Tcode is =RTCTM=. Under Testing.

** DONE [#A] Translation Keys
A translation key is a 2 characters log ID which maps to a AMDP method we called translation algorithm. SAP delivers 7 translation algorithm by default. Customers can define their own according to the interface definition. 

The 7 translation algorithm:

The maintenance view to define transaction keys and their mapping to the AMDP methods. 

** DONE [#B] CT Month-End Run
An ABAP application which is used to trigger currency translation run at month-end.

** DONE [#B] CT Detail Log
An ABAP application which can triger CT verbose run to generate detail logs.

** OPEN [#B] Investor and Investee Data Entries
An ABAP application used to record invertor and investee information. It is used in currency translation. 

Still under developing.

* Data Collection

** OPEN [#A] Flexible Upload
An ABAP application used to upload reported data from a spreadsheet. 

The Tcode: =RTCFU=. Still under developing. 

** OPEN [#A] Submit Request
The ABAP application is used for local accountants to raise data submission. 

The Tcode: =RTCRPR=. Still under developing.

* BPC Integration
Deliverables related to integration with BPC. Includes how to guides, master data HANA views, BPC extension properties, and the write-back class.
** OPEN [#A] BPC Extended Properties Maintenance View
To make BPC access the existing S/4HANA master data, some BPC needed properties should be extended to the master data entities. The way we extend the master data is to use an additional extension table. The table is then joined in the HANA views to form a complete view of master data dimensions. 
Following maintenance views are delivered:
*** DONE Extend Company Properties for BPC
*** TODO Extend Profit Center for BPC
*** TODO Extend Cost Center Properties for BPC
*** TODO Extend Segment Properties for BPC
*** TODO Extend Business Area Properties for BPC
*** TODO Extend GL Account Properties for BPC
*** DONE Extend Transaction Type for BPC
*** DONE Extend IBPF's Data Category for BPC
** OPEN [#A] Master Data HANA Views 
Most entities' HANA views is to re-use IBPF's existing ones by extending BPC needed properties. These HANA views are delivered through IBPF's package. 

The company HANA view is delivered by own.
** DONE [#A] Write-back Class
An ABAP class to write-back data from BPC to ACDOCC. Customer can use the ABAP class directly, or copy it as an example to enhance to their own requirements. 

There is also an maintenance view related to it. It is used to configure rules on document type determination based on BPC dimensions like: flow type, audit type, and so on. 
** OPEN [#A] BPC Consolidation Monitor Adjustment
BPC consolidation monitor should adapt the data submit request from RTC. The work is under developing by BPC team. 
** TODO [#A] Submit Request Status and Period Lock
Group accountants can navigate to this ABAP application from BPC consolidation monitor. It lists all the entities data submission status as well as an single entities detail view. She can also local a period for one entity or mass lock entities under a consolidation group. 

* Reporting

** OPEN [#B] AO Reporting on Translated Results in ACDOCC
A workbook example on access the translated data in ACDOCC. 

** TODO [#B] Documentation on How to build the on-the-fly Currency Translation AO Reporting.
The on-the-fly currency translation is based on AMDP methods generated by CT method definition. As we won't deliver any CT method example, so it is not possible for us to deliver a on-the-fly CT reporting. 

But it is necessary that we deliver some documentation to make customer recognize that they can now do CT on-the-fly.

** DONE [#B] ABAP Report for Drill through
An abap report based on the actual data in ACDOCA, which is used for drilling through from BPC and AO reporting. 

Currently, only local amount can be drill through. 
** DONE [#C] A Guide Documentation on How to Configure Drill through
* Basis and Utilities
Objects in this category are basis and utilities for all others.

** DONE [#A] Selections
An ABAP application used for end-users to define data selections based on consolidation views. Currently, it is mainly used in currency translation to define translation entries. 

Selection is also used during modeling to filter operational accounts.

The Tcode is: =RTCSEL=. 

** OPEN [#A] Entity Mapping
Maintenance views to define consolidation dimensions and the mapping to the account assignment fields. The additional semantic definition of entity is to simplify the UIs and consolidation views to get a uniform data processing. 

Under developing. 

** OPEN [#A] AMDP Posting API
Posting and deletion is done. Modification is under development. Reverse will be in next release. 

** OPEN [#B] Modeling Check & Validation
The logic is partially done as the model design changes a lot. Need time for the refinement. 

** TODO [#B] Transportation Utilities
A ABAP tool to package all RTC related configurations into a transport request.
