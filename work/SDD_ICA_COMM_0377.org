** Description
Here, matching item refers line items that need to be matched with each other. In the typical use cases, it can be Account Receivable and Account Payable items from 2 bilateral trading partners, or it can be payment items with external statement items. 

This communication scenario enables a remote system to post matching items to the S/4HANA tenant, so that external data can be matched and reconciled together with the data in S/4HANA. The remote system calls the synchronize SOAP inbound interface "MatchingItemCreateRequestConfirmation_In" and asynchronous SOAP inbound interface "MatchingItemBulkCreationRequest_In". Authentication is performed using user name/password or X.509 certifcate.
