** Design
Simple Upload allows user upload *local financial* data into ACDOCC in a rather simple and straight forward way. Those external FI data can then be involved in consolidation process of a RTC model.

A use case of Simple Upload can be described as bellow:
1. Accountants(either local or group) prepare the local data according to a spreadsheet template;
2. The spreadsheet template is generated according to the RTC model definition;
3. She downloads the spreadsheet template from the Simple Upload APP and convert the data format according to the 
4. She uploads the data using Simple Upload APP, the data is saved in ACDOCC and posted as a document;
5. The data can then be translated, validated, and released in Data Release Cockpit.

*** UI Mock-up
#+Caption: Simple Upload Initial Screen
[[../image/SimpleUpload01.png]]

1. User must enter 3 mandatory parameters: Model, Data Category, and Fiscal Year Period.
2. User can download a spreadsheet template. The fields of the template is derived from the model definition, that's the fields in the foundation view.
3. Entity, Partner Entity, Local CoA, Local Accounts, HSL and RHCUR are mandatory, others characteristics are freely based on the model definition.
4. Entity, Partner Entity, Local CoA, and Local Accounts should be checked for their existence in the system. If not, then the upload is aborted.
5. Amount fields should check the validity, if not, aborted.

#+Caption: Simple Upload Result Screen
[[../image/SimpleUpload02.png]]
1. User can upload data of multiple entities.
2. The result is grouped by each entity, in other word, each entity will be given one document number.
3. If one of them failed, only the failed one is aborted, and the reason is given.
4. If the entity data is successfully uploaded, a document number is generated, by clicking it will navigate you to the document detail(RTCDT). 
5. Meanwhile, a delta document is generated for each entity and each upload. You click the detail icon will popup a dialog which lists all the delta documents.
6. If there is no delta occured, then no delta document is generated for the entity. 

*** Data Simulation
The prepared local FI data is like bellow:
| Entity | P Entity | L CoA | L Account |    HSL | RHCUR | Trans Type |
|--------+----------+-------+-----------+--------+-------+------------|
| C1001  | C2001    | L001  |    100101 | 100.00 | EUR   |        100 |
| C2001  |          | L002  |    100102 | 300.00 | USD   |            |

The data in ACDOCC after it is successfully uploaded:
| Model  | D Cate | BELNR | PLVL | RYEAR | POPER | KTOPL |  RACCT | RCOMP | RASSC |    HSL | RHCUR | CONS_SL | CONS_CUR | RMVCT |
|--------+--------+-------+------+-------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+---------+----------+-------|

The data is changed(100-->110) and re-uploaded:
| Entity | P Entity | L CoA | L Account | HSL      | RHCUR | Trans Type |
|--------+----------+-------+-----------+----------+-------+------------|
| C1001  | C2001    | L001  |    100101 | *110.00* | EUR   |        100 |
| C2001  |          | L002  |    100102 | 300.00   | USD   |            |
