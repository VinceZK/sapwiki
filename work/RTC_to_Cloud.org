#+TITLE: Consolidation Should Be Real-Time

* Real-Time
When I took the topic "Real-Time Consolidation", I am always thinking what does "Real-Time" mean to an analytic APP. 

** Real-Time Data
No data replication. Of course, that is the obvious differences compared with existing solutions for decades. And Real-Time Consolidation is always the target which is chased for many years. The difficulties are:

*** Where is the real-time data?
A machine gun without bullets. Accounting system plus consolidation system.

*** Concurrency Control
ACDOCA is growing, organization is changing, so does the chart-of-accounts. Then how those changes directly impact the consolidation?

*** Real-Time Transaction

** Real-Time Modeling

* Performance

* Close to Data

* Move EC-CS to Cloud
