* Selection
Selection is a lower techique object that is used to define filter expressions on consolidation views. From techique point of view, a selection contains a base views and filter expressions on the chosen columns. After the activation, it generates a SQL where-string which afterwards can be applied at runtime. 

The main purpose of selection is to provide an UI for end-users to define their selections on consolidation data without having to ask for helps from SQL experts. Another purpose is that selection adds reusilbilty, which allows you assign them to different consolidation tasks that share the same data selection logic.

* Data Elements
** RTC_CON_MODEL
Real-Time Consolidation Model

*** Defination
RTC Model is the top most object in Real-Time Consolidation. All other objects that form the consolidation context, like: Currency Translation Method, Consolidation Document Type, Consolidation Versions, Consolidation Views, and so on are based on a model.  

*** Use
RTC Model is used to boudle all the definations, customizations, and consolidated reusult into a seprate consolidation context. 

*** Dependencies
RTC Model is SAP client dependent, but you can only have one client active for Real-Time Consolidation.

*** Examples
You define one RTC Model: =LECOMP= for legal company consolidation; one RTC Model: =MPRCTR= for managment profit center consolidation. The 2 RTC Models must be in the same client with the S/4HANA Finance's. 

** RTC_SELNM
Selection Name

*** Defination
A unique name of a selection.  

*** Use
A Selection is used to futher boundary the data in a consolidation view of a RTC Model. From technqiue point of view, a selection contains a =Base View= and the filtering expressions on its fields. After activation, a SQL where-string is generated and saved. 

*** Dependencies
You must have a RTC Model defined. Selection is created under a RTC Model, and cannot be shared among different models. 

*** Examples

** RTC_DESCRIPTION_M
Medium length description

*** Defination
Genaric medium length(80 characters long) description.

** RTC_SELTY
Selection Type

*** Defination
There are 4 selection types according to how they are constructed: 
1. Default Selection on directly assigning low and high values.
2. Selection based on SETs.
3. Freely entering SQL where-string.
4. Composite Selection unions above 3 types of selections.

*** Use
You choose different types of selection according to your needs. If you already have well-defined SETs on your G/L accounts, then you can re-use them by defining SETs-based selections. If you are familar with SQL, then use freely SQL where-string selection which allows you more flexiblity in defining your selections. Composite selection provides the union functionality for your existing selections. 

*** Dependencies

*** Examples

** RTC_BVIEW 
Base View
*** Defination
A consolidation view name for a selection to be defined on. Techniquely, it is a CDS SQL view name.

*** Use
You can only assign one base view for each selection. Base views are actually consolidation views that belongs to the RTC Model the selection resides. 

*** Dependencies
The range of the base view is dependent on a RTC Model. You can not assign other views which are not belongs to the RTC Model.

*** Examples

** RTC_FDNAM
Filter column name

*** Defination
A column in the base view which is chosen to define filters on.  

*** Use
You choose a column name from the base view so that you can define fitlers on the column. 

*** Dependencies


*** Examples

** RTC_CREATOR
Created by
*** Defination
A SAP user who created a new object.  

** RTC_MODIFYIER
Updated by
*** Defination
A SAP user who updated an existing object.

** RTC_DATE
General Date

*** Defination
Genaric Date(to day, like: 2016/01/01).

*** Use
Used genaricly for object date attributes, like, creating, updating, or activating date.

** RTC_TIME
General Time

*** Defination
Genaric Time(to seconds, like: 10:00:01)

*** Use
Used genaricly for object time attributes, like, creating, updating, or activating time.
** RTC_VALLOW
Lower value in a select-option
*** Defination
The lower value in a "from-to" filter expression.  

*** Use
When you define a filter expression for a column, you set the lower value which means filterring the value eqauls or starts from if you have the higher value defined.

*** Dependencies
Lower value must be smaller than the higher value.

** RTC_VALHIGH
Higher value in a select-option.
*** Defination
The higher value in a "from-to" filter expression. 

*** Use
When you define a filter expression for a column, you set the higher value only if you have set the lower value. Higher value alone is not reaonable as it defines the end-point ("to") for filterring. 

*** Dependencies
Higher value must be greater than the lower value.

** RTC_SGLSEL
Single Type Selection
*** Defination
Selections with types other than "Composite Selection". 

*** Use
Single type selections can be added to a composite selection to form a union set of data selections.

*** Dependencies
