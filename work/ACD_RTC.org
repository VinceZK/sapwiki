#+TITLE: ACD of Real-time Consolidation
** Abstract
Real-time Consolidation(RTC in short) is SAP's next generation financial consolidation system, which is bulit on S4HANA platform and leverages HANA's in-memory technology. 

Unlike traditional standalone consolidation applications, RTC embeds consolidation logic into a centralized financial system. The centralized system we call it Central Finance(CF in short), which makes financial operation, analysis, and planning happens in a same environment, and unifies financial master data and rules across all the local subsidiaries. 

Based on the Central Finance, RTC makes real-time financial consolidation possible in the following ways:
1. Local journals are synchronized into CF in a real-time fasion, so data mapping and consolidation rules will aslo be applied real-timely at journal level.
2. No additional data copy and batch job is needed when running consolidation. Consolidated results can be made on-the-fly directly based on journal items. 
3. Consolidate results can be traced back to the  original transactions.
4. Local financial close, corrections, and updates can be instancely noticed.
5. Planning and simulation can be made on consolidated results, and vice versa. 

The high level consolidation building blocks (backlogs) includes:
- Data modelling based on multi-dimension database view.
- Data collection and validation.
- Inter-company reconciliation.
- Currency translation.
- Consolidation and elimination.
- Reporting.
- Collaborations.

** Background and Context
Financial consolidation systems are the "engine room" of the corporate finance department, enabling companies of all sizes to comply with regulatory reporting requirements, company law and global accounting standards as well satisfy management's need for periodic management reporting.

But all is not well with standalone consolidation applications that were developed since 1990's. Among them, SAP already has three: BPC, BCS, and EC-CS. Those consolidation solutions are still commonplace in some of the world's largest multinationals. According to one recent research, 47 percent of companies have made substantial investments in their financial close, filling, and reporting. Yet, despite the considerable sums of money invested in the process, management teams across the globe remain dissatisfied with the quality and timeliness of management information.

With the emergence of S4HANA and the concept of central finance, we can build an embedded financial consolidation solution based on them. As financial data is already centralized, it is not necessary to replicate it again to a standalone consolidation system. Meanwhile, RTC can also gain more from the future S4HANA Cloud platform, because of the highly distributed nature of the financial close process. It can help to standardlize and harmonize the data collection, imporve collaborations, and significantly reduce reporting delay between local operational systems and the corporate consolidation.

*** Number of Customers expected with release now in development 
25+ customers have explicitly stated high interest on Real-time Consolidation.

*** Underlying Platform/Application Server
RTC is built on S4HANA, both On-Premise and Cloud, with On-Premise version delivering first. 

*** Product Type

*** Business Case
Consolidation is discussed in 80 % of the cases of which we have customer discussions on CF. CF carries all the financial data from the entire system landscape. It is not understood by customers why they need to load the data from somewhere else for the consolidation. Group reporting on CF has limited informative value without consolidation.CF is supplied in real-time. Necessary corrections in local close are updated real-timely. There is no need for the waiting of ETL.

Here are 2 large corporations that both have financial consolidation running on a centralized finance data repository. The requirements are always there,  

**** Sinopec
Sinopec already has a centralized finance system with all its subsidiaries financial data consolidated. AGS team implemented a solution that allow BCS consume this consolidated data directly through BW virtual info-providers and HANA calculation views. Thus reduce the ETL process, and Sinopec already gets benefits from that solution. 

**** Siemens
Siemens has established a so called global template. That means that the group defines the master data centrally, but there is ample possibility for the subsidiaries to extend the master data, for example to create additional accounts in the account hierarchy below a central given account. This is actually a quite frequent approach. Siemens does this with a naming convention: the first 6 digits are reserved for the group, digit 7 and 8 are reserved for the division, the last two digits are reserved for the subsidiary. Exception are all account numbers containing the digit 9, they are reserved for the subsidiary.

*** Main Use Cases / Functional Scope

**** Year-End close (pre)consolidation
Traditional consolidation takes days. It needs to extract data from group's sub financial systems, which needs the sub systems finish the closing first. Then transform the data, and load it to the consolidation system. The overall closing and ETL process are very time-consuming. No bother to mention if corrections are needed, the entire process could be re-processed. Corporation stakeholders suffers waiting too long a period for consolidated statements. While Real-time Consolidation can perfectly solve the problem. RTC is based on Central Finance which acts as a central repository for all the financial data, it synchronizes journals from sub systems in a real-time fashion. RTC does consolidations directly based on the central journal repository. There is no additional data replicas needed, Consolidation experts can do pre-consolidations at anytime, without notifying sub financial system to close first.Thus he/she can find problems before year-end closing consolidation actually happens. This permits corrections can be made in sub systems before-hand. Besides, consolidation rules can even be applied in the document posting processes, which guarantee efficient and effective financial controls.

**** Acquisition & Re-organization 
When a new business entity is added/removed from the organization, management teams want see the simulated consolidated results immediately to support decision.RTC can well cope this kind of requirements.

** Boundary Conditions
Real-time Consolidation(RTC in short) runs mainly based on Central Finance(CF in short), which can synchronize journals from all the subsidiary finance systems in a real-time fashion. CF realizes the so-called "Transactional BW"(through SLT and MDG), which breaks through the world of OLTP and OLAP. Compared to traditional ETL-based BW system, CF can significantly improve the raw data quality and reduce the delay of reporting. 
  
In other case, corporations may already have their subsidiaries using a centralized finance system (based on S4HANA finance). Thus the data synchronization is not necessary. RTC then can be run directly on S4HANA finance without the CF.
 
In both cases, RTC requires a centralized finance system that already have all the local journals consolidated in a central repository. It is under that assumption can RTC do further financial consolidation models and processes. RTC will also leverage(or reuse) SAP existing consolidation applications, like: BPC, BCS, and EC-CS. In it's initial releases, RTC will consider BPC as the main consolidation front-end.

*** Reuse
List the reuse components (engines, objects, intrinsic/common services, 3rd party components) which have to be used for this development program/project/topic/integration scenario. Mention reuse components which explicitly must not be used within this development program.

General Principles for Reuse
- Take reuse into account in every architecture definition. Well planned reuse has a big positive influence on stability, quality, common look and feel, TCO and TCD of the complete application.
- But consider the costs in relationship to the benefits when reusing a function or feature from others. In especially check if the prerequisites (system, hardware, licenses, implementation and customizing efforts, etc) which are required to use the reuse functions are acceptable for customers. If you answer one of the following questions with yes please consult with your local reuse expert
- Does the used service or functionality force the customer to install an additional system?
- Does the usage of a service or functionality force the customer to implement and customize a new application or technology hub?
- Does the new framework or functionality which is planned exist in a similar version in other areas (Examples are rules engines, business object frameworks, master data, ...)?

Recommendations

If you want to develop a new framework or functionality which could be of interest for other groups too, please check whether synergies would be possible.

The following reuse components must/should/must not be used within this development:

| <15>            | <15>            | <5>   | <5>   | <30>                           |
| Reuse Component | Owned by        | Maintenance Guaranteed? | Usage | Remark / explanation           |
|-----------------+-----------------+-------+-------+--------------------------------|
| HRF 1.0 SP06    | HRF team        | Yes   | must  | HANA Rule Framework must be used to build RTC's validation engine. The validation engine should permit both high performance and easy rule maintenance for LOB users. RTC use HRF to push rule validation down to HANA level. |
| BRF+ 2.0        | BRF team        | Yes   | must  | BRF+ must be used for the reason of the compliance with S4HANA guideline. HRF cannot be used directly, and must indirectly through BRF+. Compared to HRF, BRF+ is running on ABAP level which could not permits good performance on mass data processing. RTC should combine the advantages of HRF and BRF+. |
| CDS 1.0         | CDS team        | Yes   | must  | Use CDS for modeling when ever possible. CDS is SAP's future business script targets to Cloud. Although it has function limitation and not mature enough, but we should use it as much as possible. |
| Fiori 1.0       | Fiori team      | Yes   | must  | Fiori must be used for all the UI. Fiori is the future S4HANA UI that targets to Cloud. RTC must not use any other Web UI framework, or develop its own framework. Traditional SAPGUI(including HTML GUI) is only allowed for intermediate purpose. |
| IBPF info-objects | IBPF team       | Yes   | must  | IBPF developed a lot of finance planning BW info-objects. RTC can re-used them, or do some extension whenever necessary. Beside, RTC and IBPF should combine efforts so that Consolidation and Planning can happen together. |
| Design Studio   | EPM team        | Yes   | must  | Design Studio is used to create queries. The query can be opened via various analysis tools, like: AO, Fiori Apps, and so on. It is appointed by S4HANA guideline for the only query builder, and will replace BEx in future. |
| BEx Query       | BW team         | Yes   | should | BEx query should only be used when Design Studio is not possible, or for some test purpose. |
| HANA Calculation View | HANA team       | Yes   | should | HANA Calculation view should be only used for the purpose to integrated with BPC. Other cases should use CDS instead. |
| BW              | BW team         | Yes   | should | BW cube should only be used for the purpose to integrated with BPC. RTC should avoid using BW cubes as it violate with S4HANA guideline, and it is not the future. |
| BPC 10.1        | BPC team        | Yes   | should | BPC should be used when ever possible. BPC is the only legal financial consolidation and planning system in SAP. RTC should provide the possibility to allow BPC run on CF seamlessly. In some cases if BPC cannot be used, RTC should also provide some core functionalities that can propose values for customers. |
| CF 1.0          | CF Wdf team     | Yes   | should | CF should be used when customer what its de-centralized finance systems to be somehow centralized. If a totally centralized finance system is not possible, than establishing a centralized journal repository for group reporting and analysis can be realized by CF. RTC then can use the CF to form it's data basis. |
| EC-CS           | IMS team        | Yes   | should | EC-CS is SAP's legacy ERP embedded consolidation application. EC-CS share a lot common features and ideas with RTC, like do consolidation directly on line items. RTC should research, reuse, and adopt EC-CS's functionalities whenever possible. |
| BCS             | IMS team        | Yes   | should | BCS is the legacy consolidation application based on BW that some large corporation clients are still in-use. BCS has more functionalities than BPC, but with old-style UIs and too strict, somehow, too proficient, that not all the customers like it. A lot of BCS features and functionalities could be researched, reused, and adopt to RTC. |

*** Cross-Release Compatibility
Describe boundary conditions to ensure smooth upgrade / migration.

General Principles for Cross-Release Compatibility

A new release of an SAP application can always be integrated with any release of any other SAP application that is still in mainstream and extended maintenance. After an upgrade of an SAP application, all previously used scenarios are still available.

Release Synchronization schema to be followed (Details see[[https://portal.wdf.sap.corp/wcm/ROLES://portal_content/cp/roles/cto/DevelopmentResources/ReleaseStrategyTransparency/Infocenters/WS%2520PTG/PTG/Operations%2520%2526%2520Program%2520Office/Release%2520Management][/go/releasemanagement]])

*** Other External Forces / Constraints and Assumptions
Describe other external forces, constraints and assumptions, which influence or restrict your architecture. This could also be resource, skillset and timeline constraints, etc.

Real-time Consolidation highly depends on Central Finance. CF provides the data bases for the RTC to consume. The successfully implementation of CF puts directly impacts on RTC.

BPC is the only legal consolidation and planning product in SAP. RTC may be bundled with BPC for sales and marketing. If BPC

** Architecture Definition
The architecture chapter describes the main building blocks of the architecture and their relationships. Depict also how the building blocks are integrated with building blocks outside the program/topic.

~For conceptual and technical architecture diagrams use~ [[http://ency.wdf.sap.corp:1080/Modeling/Standard][Technical Architecture Modeling (TAM)]]. 

*** Architecture Context and Overview
Describe how the software developed within this project relates to existing SAP software,
Provide an architecture overview diagram which depicts all major component and their relationships. Describe the overall architecture concept and explain the role of each component.

We recommend to describe the architecture according to the following sequence
First, explain the concepts, on which the architecture is based. This may be business concepts, technical concepts or patterns. ARIS diagrams block diagrams, or entity-relationship diagrams may be useful for visualization.

Second, give the component view of your architecture. What are the building blocks and how do they relate to each other. Include a block diagram.

Third, describe behavior of the system/components (dynamic view). You may use an activity diagram to visualize it.

RTC mainly interacts with 3 SAP applications: CF, BPC, and IBPF. Each takes a role as following:

1. *CF* provides a data fundation(ACDOCA) for RTC to create models on it.
2. *RTC* enable the user to do typical consolidation preparation, like: data validation, currency translation, Inter-company reconciliation, and so on.
3. *BPC* is the main consolidation tools that can be seamlessly integrated with RTC to do higher level consolidations and eliminations.
4. *IBPF* is highly integrated with RTC. Which can do planning and simulation on the consolidation results, and vice versa. 

Details on each building blocks and their relationships are explained below.

#+CAPTION: Overall Architecture Diagram
[[../image/Overall%20Architecture%20Diagram.png]]

**** Line Item Level Data Integration
Local financial systems synchronize their line items into CF's central journal repository(ACDOCA). The synchronization is realized through SLT. It is a middle-ware which can listen changes at database level and synchronize the updates to CF real-timely. 

Data mapping happens when the newly created items are entering into CF through a master data mapping application called MDG(Master Data Governance). Mater data is mapped from local to group, these could includes: Accounts, Chart of Accounts, company code, cost center, and so on. 

There is also an error handling component(AIF) which centrally process all the processing logs. If error happens, the context is saved for future re-process. 

This building block is developed and maintained by CF's Walldolf team. RTC is highly depends on this component which permits data quality and timeliness. Meanwhile, RTC provides validation and currency translation services to CF. Additional consolidation rules and currency translations are applied before line items posted to ACDOCA.   

**** Manual Adjustment Posting
Adjustments can be maded by posting additional financial documents. These adjustment documents can be either posted in orignal local financial systems and then synchronized to CF, or posted direclty in CF. In both cases, the consolidastion validation rules and currency translation should be applied. The latter case should also reuse the existing document posting UI.

If ACDOCC is used, user can also has the option to post documents to ACDOCC. Then a more light document posting UI would be provided by RTC, and less posting validation would be applied.  

**** Data Modeling
Data modeling is creating multi-dimension views based on foundation tables. These foundation tables includes: ACDOCA, ACDOCC, and ACDOCP. ACDOCA is the central jouranl repository, which should contain all the jouranls the corporation has. ACDOCC is somehow aggregated journal repository only stores the consolidated results. ACDOCC is dotted, because it is still under consideration whether needed or not comparing direclty saving consolidation results into ACDOCA. This will be further disscussed in the next section. ACDOCP is for planning data, it is also aggregated journal repository that created and maintained by IBPF team. 

Besides those three foundation tables, there are also quite a lot of master data tables. The master data tables should be associalated to the a foundation table to form a multi-dimension view. Master data could be freely extended, both horizantal and vertical,  according to various consolidation requirements.

This building block is dotted because it can be replaced by BPC's modeling tool. In case BPC is not possible due to release strategy or other reasons, RTC should provide a flexible modeling tool. In both cases, RTC should provide a modeling API that can generate BW/CDS multi-dimension views, and allow other consolidation tools to integrate with. 

**** Data Explosure via BW/CDS
Multi-dimension views can be created either using BW info-providers or using CDS analytic views. They are both underlying modeling technologies that Data modeling tool depends on. The BW info-provider is only used to integrate with BPC and BCS. As both of them are build on BW components. 

CDS analytic views are preferred as it is SAP's future modeling scripts, and the only modeling technology allowed by S4HANA guideline. The expectation is that BW can support CDS well, so that there is no need to support 2 different modeling technologies. 

**** Data Collection
Data is collected from all the subsidiaries, or the de-centralized systems through various ways. In the best situation, CF already helps to collect all the data correclty and timely. Then this building block only provides validation reports to make sure the local financail data is correct and ready for the consolidation. 

But in more realistic cases, data is not that ready enough for consolidation. Some subsidiaries data may not be able to automatically synchronize into CF, or even CF is not the right approach for some instances. In that way, RTC should provide a flexible data upload mechanism which may support spreadsheets upload, manually entering, and web services APIs. Through these flexible interfaces, the raw data will be validated upon consolidation rules, and posted into ACDOCA.

The data collection process accesses foundation tables through CDS views, which are annoted with write-back classes. There are 2 reasons why not use ABAP coding:
1. CDS can make data validation pushed down to HANA.
2. CDS is easy to explosure to multiple front-end tools.

**** Inter-company Reconciliation 
Inter-company Reconciliation (ICR in short) provides you with periodic control over accounting documents that describe the accounting transactions within a corporate group. Designed to reduce the differences in corporate group consolidation, this application in Financial Accounting allows early analysis in the closing process to avoid differences altogether and to reduce the deadline pressure that normally arises during the end of a closing period.

ICR operates on the level of companies and its trading partners. To avoid currency conversion differences, the documents are reconciled in the *transaction currency*. Both individual companies and their parent companies benefit from ICR. Individual companies benefit from paired documents because they need to ensure that their own documents from accounting transactions correspond to the documents of internal trading partners. This helps avoid delays and disputes when payments are processed. Their parent companies can then make a global check on the reconciliation results for all the companies.

You can regard ICR as a special prcoess that belongs to data collection. It is such a common usage that SAP already has this feature as a seperate component called [[https://help.sap.com/saphelp_erp_fao_addon20/helpdata/en/d7/5a7c525ae17154e10000000a44176d/frameset.htm][SAP ICR]]. ICR supports the following three reconciliation processes:

1. *G/L open items reconciliation.* This process is for reconciliation of open items if most of your intercompany receivables and payables are posted to G/L accounts.
2. *G/L account reconciliation.* You use this process for reconciliation of documents that are posted to accounts which do not have open item management. This process is mostly used for reconciliation of profit and loss accounts.
3. *Customer / vendor open items reconciliation.* You use this process for reconciliation of open items. Choose this process if most of your intercompany receivables and payables are posted to customer and vendor accounts.

Currently, ICR has both dynpro UI and webdynpro UI, but without Fiori. Evaluation should be made to check if current webdynpro app can be enhanced, or new Fiori UI could be developed. The new ICR UI will access ACDOCA data through CDS explosure, and need the consolidation scope definition and reconciliation rules to be defined in the validation engine. 

**** Consolidation and Elimination 
Consolidation and elimination are two actions that usually happen together. At most time, we simplely called it "consolidation". Consolidation means do aggreations on the ammount that belongs to the same dimension group. Elimination means some related ammounts should be eliminated to avoid unnecessary counting. Elimination usually happens between 2 trading partners, for example: Partner A sold something to partner B with ammount 100 dollars. Both A and B are belong to the same business group. So, from group's point of view, the transaction ammount $100 should be eliminated.

How consolidation processes depends on the rules defined in the rule engine. Customers usually define consolidation rules based on their own needs. There are also standard rules to follow, like: GAAP and IFRS, which are legal requirements that all the coorporations must follow. 

There could be difference generated during consolidation. For example, when local currency ammount is translated to group currency ammount, due to the fluctuation of currency rate, the translated group ammount could be unbalanced. Thus, adjustment documents would be posted automatically, and the difference ammount will be recorded to an account that specified in the rule engine. 

The process runs hours in traditional Consolidation applications. But within Real-time Consolidation, it should be done in minutes(without schedualing any batch jobs). Sometimes, it could be run on-the-fly without doing any document posting. For example, when the operator wants to see updated results after small adjustments or new journals come in.   

This building block could include APIs and UIs that are used to initiate, monitor, and get results from the consolidation process.  
 
**** Consolidation Group/Scope Definition
Under research

**** Reporting
Reports or queries are based on multi-dimension views that explosed either by BW or CDS. Tools like Query Designer or BEx Query Builder could be used to create queries based on multi-dimension views. Those queries can be then consumed by AO and Fiori.

Reports could be organized by consolidation hierarchies.

There are report-to-report navigation. AO has existing solution that supports worksheet to worksheet, worksheet to webdynpro, and worksheet to SAPGUI. Fiori APPs should develop corresponding navigation features to existing list reports and detail transactions. The consolidastion trace back requirements are actully realized through these report-to-report navigations. 

**** Validation Engine
Validation Engine is a core component for storing and running consolidation rules. Rules could be applied in data collection, Inter-company reconciliation, consolidation and elimination, line item level data integration, and manual adjustment posting. 

Validation Engine will be built on existing rule frameworks HRF and BRF+. HRF stands for Hana Rule Framework. Rules maintained in HRF can be applied on HANA level, which permits good performance. BRF+ stands for Business Rule Framework plus. BRF+ is an ABAP framework that can be easily integrated into ABAP codes. BRF+ can be used to integrate HRF in the form of DB vocabulary.

*** Integration with other Systems
Depict how the software to be developed communicates with other applications and systems. Include a block diagram illustrating the integration.

**** Public APIs and Contracts
List all public APIs/enterprise services which are offered, be it newly created API or changes on existing APIs
| Name of API/Contract | Type                          | Changed/New | Description |
|----------------------+-------------------------------+-------------+-------------|
|                      | sync/async web services, RFC, |             |             |

*** Security 
Describe how the architecture protects the software against attacks or misuse.

To do so, define how communication channels (protocol, data, ...) are protected. Describe how authentication, authorization and logging are performed. Consider architecture requirements pertaining to confidentiality, integrity and availability. 

*** Deployment and Operations
It is recommended to work with the local Technical Component and Delivery Architecture (TCDA) team on defining deployment and operations architecture. Contact is the "Delivery Architecture Engineer" maintained in [[https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/sap(bD1lbiZjPTAwMSZpPTEmcz1TSUQlM2FBTk9OJTNhcHdkZjU3ODJfSUZQXzAxJTNhWEhRWUJUMFlnaXNneEZlWWZTemIwR1FhWnZxaXotY2lkX1Z3TUF0Zy1BVFQ=)/bc/bsp/sap/zpr/default.htm][program repository]] entry of your program.

**** Deployed Component Structure and Deployment Options
Show all interdependencies of (groups of) software components using a package diagram (TAM). Assign the components to software layers, for example see: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/display/archGov/Software+Layers

Describe software component structure, package structure and their deployment options. Deployment options describe the different possibilities how the software components can be distributed across different systems. Indicate cross-component communication. Mention explicitly, if there are new dependencies between software components.

Describe deployment unit and process component structure if relevant.

**** System Landscape
Describe typical system landscape required to run the software developed within this program productive at a customer site. Show how the main deployable building blocks are distributed within that landscape. Determine which landscape components are mandatory and which are optional to run the software

**** Operation Concept
Describe how the planned software is operated and estimate the impact on TCO. This includes a rough description of complexity of installation, configuration, update, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Explain also how easy product and landscape optimization can be done during product lifecycle (such as scalability and high availability).

In case TCO is high, explain a roadmap how simplification in next versions can be done (for example from complexity hiding to complexity reduction).

*** Testing
Think about the test approach, especially if you enter new technology areas where the existing test tools cannot be used or where the existing test tools need to be enhanced.

*** Architecture Details (Further Refinement)
Use further chapters to refine the architecture and describe specific topics.

*** Architecture Risks
Explain your view on architecture-related risks and give hints about potential upcoming problems. Risks can arise for example from changes in the scope, from work-arounds necessary, from dependencies on other components, or from immature technologies/concepts. Fill in the table for each risk.

**** Risk: title
| <15>            | <60>                                                         |
| Description     | Example: To improve performance a cache will be implemented. However the cache only shows effect for objects with more than 1000 attributes. |
| Impact(for customer) | Example: customers see no effect when using cache with objects with less than 1000 attributes |
| Impact Rating   | Impact Rating                                                |
| Risk Probability | Low/High/Very High                                           |
| Mitigation Activity | Example: cache can be activated/de-activated. In addition describe in documentation when cache is useful and when not. |
| Responsible Person | Name of person responsible for risk mitigation activity      |
| Due Date        | Due date for mitigation                                      |

*** Planned Design Documents
Here the sprint teams can list the software design documents (SDD), which will  be created in order to implement the architecture. The list can also be created over time.

** Glossary
Add definitions of terms which are relevant for understanding the document to the glossary. As alternative add the terms to the [[https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/ArGlossary/Contribute+to+SAP%2527s+Architecturepedia][architecture glossary in the Wiki]].
