** Design
*** Key Requirements and Design Goals
Currency Translation of RTC should fully leverage HANA technology, so that a distinguished performance boost can be gain. It targets on translating financial statements from one currency to another currency. The translation algorithm can be customized or enhanced in an easy and understandable way. 

**** Following Design Goals *MUST* be Met:
1. The core translation algorithm must be pushed down to HANA.
2. Currency translation can be run on-the-fly for a consolidation unit. 
3. There must be a way to easily define exchange rates or find translated values.
4. The delivered translation algorithm must cover most of the translation cases in financial consolidation.
5. Translation algorithm can be customized and enhanced by customer.
6. Translation difference can be well represented.
7. Rounding difference can be well handled.
8. The translated result can be posted to ACDOCC as documents. 
9. There must be audit trails to record who, when, and what of a currency translation run.

**** Following Design Goals *SHOULD* be Met:
1. The calculation is done by HANA function: CONVERT_CURRENCY.
2. The translation algorithm should be realized using AMDP(HANA SQL scripts).
3. Analytic Office can directly consume outputs of translation algorithm. 
4. TCUR* tables should be reused to define exchange rates and rate types.
5. Data filtering should re-use SAP SET, as it already provides customization UI.
6. User can easily define the parameters of its currency translation run.
7. Provisional run should be provided in case group values are not ready for reconciliation.
8. Currency Translation can be run repeatedly either in delta mode, or in replace mode.
9. Differential item can be breakdown by sub-assignments.

*** Context
Currency Translation enables you to translate financial data reported by consolidation units into the currency of your consolidation group.

Financial data reported by consolidation units is usually collected in the Consolidation application in local currency. You need to translate this data into group currency before you can create consolidated financial statements.

*** Major Building Blocks
Currency Translation of RTC should push the main translation algorithm into HANA, so that performance can be guaranteed when running on huge amount of data. Besides, CT of RTC should be in a simple and clear philosophy that further enhancement and hack would be possible. The overall design diagram can be described like this:

#+Caption: Currency Translation Overview
[[../image/CurrencyTranslation.png]]  

The whole component can be divided into 2 parts: one is customization, which includes some configuration UIs that allow users easily define their translation parameters; The other is the runtime program flow, which is realized mainly using AMDP. All yellow blocks are involved in this development, and all white ones stands for already existing objects.

Currently, the design mainly refers EC-CS and BCS. It seems too sophisticate and not simple enough for attracting more future developments. It is worth to have more research on how BPC realizes its currency translation. We would leverage the 2 kinds of philosophy: customization-based & rule-based. 

Details of each building blocks of currency translation are explained:

**** Exchange Rate Indicator        :Chang:
Exchange Rate Indicator is mapped to exchange rate type. In EC-CS, you can also map multiple exchange rate types to one indicator, with validation period assigned to each type. 

The development could be a maintenance view of a mapping table. User can define multiple indicators. The Exchange Rate Type, Translation Ratios, and Exchange Rates maintenance views can be re-used.  

Here, it is good to understand TCUR* tables. Understand how CONVERT_CURRENCY find the exchange rate through exchange rate type. 

**** Selection CDS View      :Chang:
A =Selection CDS View= is based on =Cons. Area CDS View= by adding filters on FS items and sub-items. 

There should be a customization tool to allow user to create =Selection CDS View= easily rather then using CDS modeling tool. It is not just adding some where conditions, but also doing fields mapping from the =Cons Area CD View= to table ACDOCC. 

=Selection CDS View= should have the same fields with =Cons Area CDS View=.  =Cons. Area CDS View='s fileds should be the sub-set of ACDOCC's, or ACDOCC can not hold all the information that =Cons Area CDS View= has. The de-projection from =Selection CDS View= to ACDOCC needs to map the existing fields, and add fix values or null values to those non-existing fields.   

**** Translation Method Customization                                 :Chang:
Translation method contains a list of currency translation entries and rounding entries. In runtime, the entries can be executed parallel. But rounding entries must be executed after all translation entries finsihed.

A =Translation Entry= contains a Selection CDS View, an Exchange Rate Indicator. a translation key, a pair of differential items(with subitems if configured), and some other settings. In other words, it contains all the context and control parameters that a translation algorithm needs.

A =Rounding Entry= contains one or two rounding areas, and a pair of rounding differences items. Rounding algorithm can be fixed into 3 types:
1. If one rounding area is defined, you can only do rounding check by sum all the amount to see if the result is 0.
2. If two rounding areas are defended, you can check whether the sum of each area's amount is equal, or
3. you add the 2 summarized amount to see if it equals 0.

User is allowed to defined multiple translation methods, but only one method is allowed to assign to a single consolidation unit. You achieve this during the consolidation task definition. A task, for example, currency translation can contains multiple translation methods. Each method is then assigned to a unit in the task configuration. 

**** Translation Method Runtime API       :Steve:
An AMDP method that runs all the translation entries and rounding entries defined in the translation method customization. Unions all the return lists of each entry run, and outputs the result by different ways (to CDS views, to posting API, or exposed by services). Details can be found in the following diagram:

#+Caption: Currency Translation Method Run 
[[../image/CT_MethodRun.png]]  

The program will first get all the translation entries and rounding entries saved in a customization table. Then loop the entries, pass the parameters of each entry to the method =RunSingleEntryTranslation=. The =RunSingleEntryTranslation= method check the translation key configured and apply the correct translation algorithm. 

For example, if one translation entry is configured with currency translation key '1', then algorithm =RunTranslationKey1= is applied. Each translation algorithm is again an AMDP method which are pre-developed and has a well-defined interface. 

After all entries finished, the results of each algorithm are union-ed into one list. The list contains all the items of a translated financial statement. If rounding entries are defined, rounding algorithms are then applied and rounding difference items are added. 

The final result can then be consumed by =OnTheFly-Reporting= and =CurrencyTranslationPost=. It is also expected that the result can be consumed by other processes.   

**** Translation Algorithms               :Marvin:Jane:
A translation algorithm deal with a single translation area, with one exchange rate indicator, and one pair of differential items. In the translation area, all the FS items apply the same translation logic with the same exchange rate, and records difference to the same differential items. 

A translation algorithm maps to a translation key, which is a character value(from '0' to 'Z') used during customizing. Or you can say: A translation key is a unique name of a translation algorithm. The number of translation keys can be enumerated in finance consolidation. In EC-CS, only 11 keys are delivered(0~A). The use of the algorithms can also be combined with input parameters, which then can fulfill various practical use cases. 

There comes the question of why RTC uses the concept =Translation Key=. As it is such a redundant concept only produces confusion. Because fundamentally, translation algorithm is simple. It finds the correct exchange rate, then multiply it with the source amount to get the target amount, and process the difference if different rates are used to different sets of FS items. User can then just use a multi-dimensional configuration UI to set dimensional parameters to get a dedicate translation algorithm.

Answer to that question is that it is difficult to generate an algorithm based on configuration. For most cases, you can use exchange rate tables to get the right rate, but other cases require you get an already translated amount in somewhere (access other tables). And the =Source Amount= is also tricky, sometimes it is just a field in your table; sometimes, it is a cumulative value. To achieve this, you must need dynamic programing. Either you write a program that is powerful enough to recognize all the customization combinations, or the algorithm program is generated automatically after customizing. ABAP maybe can afford it, but not HANA SQL scripts. HANA SQL scripts is a declarative language, dynamic programing for SQL scripts is somehow not effective. And it always has drawbacks on performance. 

With the =Translation Keys=, the limit number of them can be hard-coded in the main program. According to the customization, difference algorithm is applied to different translation entries which are flagged with a dedicate translation key. For end-users, they must have some time to get familiar with these keys, and the logic behind them. 

~Not sure if EC-CS has the same reason for its 11 translation keys!~

Detail logic of a generic translation algorithm can be described as in the following diagram:

#+Caption: Currency Translation Algorithm for a Single Set 
[[../image/CT_SingleSetAlgorithm.png]]  

Currency Translation Area is derived from consolidation area and FS item set. Translation area provides source amount, source currency key, and target currency key to the HANA function CONVERT_CURRENCY. 

Exchange Rate Indicator tells CONVERT_CURRENCY which conversion type and reference data should be used. According to all this information, the HANA function can get the translated result. 

~The acutal exchange rate is not shown here, that would be a problem if user want see the exact rate used for the translation. The workround solution is to use another function to get the rate seperately~

CONVERT_CURRENCY is called twice each at FS item line. One to get the reference target amount 1, and the other is for the specific target amount 2. Translation difference is then calculated by substarcting them (Target Amount 2 - Target Amount 1). This is the intial translation result noted as =Internal_Table1=. For some processes, the reuslt is already enough. 

As for financial consolidation, the translated results should be converted to financial statements format. Thus, the difference should be recorded to a differential item. The final represtation form of =Internal_Table2= is required. Differential items are configurated in the translation entries.    

**** Subitem Assignment
Subitem assignment can be used to further narrow the consolidation area by adding additional filters other than FS item SET. 

**** Currency Translation Area            :Frank:
Currency Translation Area is a data context that a translation algorithm is running on. It is derived from consolidation area, with further filtering on FS items and other characteristics. Items in a consolidation area shares the same parameters and algorithm.  

If the RTC is only designed for FI, the answer could be possible "YES". But consolidation algorithm should not be limited to FI. If the data basis is mainly on this kind of hierarchy-like finance structure, it will limit the future usages. Following questions should be think deeper:

1. Is it possible using CDS instead of FS item set?
2. Is it possible using Validation Engine to allow flexible data stream definition?
3. Why EC-CS creates another FS structure for consolidation instead of using FSV?

To answer the above questions, following research task could be done:
1. Combine CDS and HRF to boundary the data area for everything?
2. If FS item set is defined, the corresponding CDS view and HRF vocabulary(Alias is considerable) are also generated.
3. Currency Translation and Inter-Unit Elimination will choose actually the CDS and Vocabulary correlated.
4. There must be some fields mandatory for a specific task. Take currency translation as an example, an amount field, a currency key field, and an account field should exist.

**** On-The-Fly Translation                :Jane:                              
Given an FSV, Translation procedures (cumulative and period), Rate Indicators, Differential FS Items, I could run currency translation on-the-fly. 

An AMDP function will be developed which calls HANA function =CONVERT_CURRENCY= based on data and logic provided above. The output of AMDP should be an FSV-like hierarchy structure which again is mapped to an CDS view. I can use AO to view the translated result. Following outputs are expected:
1. Code is clean and neat.
2. Could be no input parameters, but the output should a FSV-like table.
3. Must have 2 different translation procedures: cumulative and period.
4. Must have following rate indicators: spot rate, current rate, average rate, and history rate.
5. Different translation procedures and rate indicators should be applied to different FS item sets.
6. The translation differences should generate additional lines and assigned to different differential FS items.
7. The output Balance Sheet and Income Statement should be correct, and can be viewed using AO.
8. Error handling should be processed in an elegant way.
9. Trace back to original document line. 

Need Carol's help to provide an FSV and related FS items. All other stuff can be mocked. 

**** Final Translation (with posting)    
Based on the =Translation on-the-fly=, I can post the translated results to ACDOCC. I can build CDS views on ACDOCC so that the final translation result can be viewed through reporting tools. 

According to different translation procedures, some amount could be read from ACDOCA, so it could be a union of ACDOCA and ACDOCC to represent the final translated result.

The posting API should ready at that time.
