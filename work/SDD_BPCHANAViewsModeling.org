** Design
*** Key Requirements and Design Goals
BPC need access the real-time data in ACDOCA with timestamp filtering. 

The requirement comes from the legal consolidation which require strict data process control. Only the data that local accountants sumitted can group accountants run validation and consolidation on them. But if we let BPC access data on ACDOCA directly, group accountants will always access the latest data without a handover control. Meanwhile, as the data in ACDOCA is always changing, it will also cause the data inconsistency during a consolidation process run. 

The solution is to use a pull request to record the time when the local accountant close his period and submit the range of data for consolidation. And BPC access the data in ACDOCA only before the timestamp. 

*** Context
A [[https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/ERPFINDEV/SDD-Pull+Request+for+Consolidation][Pull Request]] is raised by a local accountant as a data handover document. It contains information like:mode, category,  entity, fiscal year/period, and close timestamp. The group accountant uses this filter information to pull data from ACDOCA for further validation and consolidation. 

The pull requests are stored in table =RTC_PULL_REQ=, with additional user status and system status control. If a pull request is in status "Raised", group accountant can run validation on the data it points; If a pull request is in status "Approved", BPC consolidation engine can see the data it points; And only if the pull request is in user status "Approved", and consolidation runs successfully(system status equals "Processed"), can consolidation reports run on the data it points. 

Because BPC/BW can not pass filtering parameters, so currently, it is impossible for BPC to using timestamp do any filtering before the consolidation logic. RTC will provide BPC with HANA views that already join with the pull request table. This approach will cause multiple HANA views to be provided for different purpose. BPC now should be able to differeniate them when doing cerntain consolidation tasks. 

The overall diagram can be seen as this: 

#+Caption: HANA Views for BPC
[[../image/ConsViews03.png]]

*Note:*
1. =This design still doesn't cover the delta coonsolidation senario. My feeling is that to achieve delta consolidation we must have BW pass timestamp as parameters.=
2. =Defer case is not considered=

8 HANA calculation views will be provided for BPC. They are unioned under a composite provider, on which aggregation level will be created. Then if I want do a legal consolidation, I(BPC) should access data in "Cons. Result View", "Legal View C for Consolidation", and "Legal View A for consolidation"; If I want to access real-time data to do a Preliminary consolidation, BPC should only access "Cons. Result View", "Preliminary View C", and "Preliminary View A". The detail difference and usage for the 8 HANA calculation views are explained bellow:

**** Consolidation Result View
Based on ACDOCC, only expose the consolidation result of the former periods.
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select * from ACDOCC
          where MODEL = 'RTC001'
            and RYEAR = '2016'
            and BPC_CATG = 'Actual'
            and POPER < '<this-period>'
            and DELFLG = ''.
#+END_SRC

**** Legal View C for Validation 
Based on ACDOCC, those flexible uploaded data of current period. The view is created on ACDOCC join with the pull request table on document number. The pull request table should first filter out these items with user status equals 'Raised' or 'Approved'.
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  create view I_PULL_REQ_R as 
    select MODEL, BPC_CATT, FYEAR, FPERI, ENTITY, BELNR, max(CTIME)
            from RTC_PULL_REQ
            where ( USTATUS = 'Raised' or USTATUS = 'Approved' )
              and REQ_TYPE = 'FLEXUPL'
            group by MODEL, BPC_CATT, FYEAR, FPERI, ENTITY, BELNR;

  select * from ACDOCC as C
           join I_PULL_REQ_R as P
             on C.MODEL = P.MODEL

            and P.FPERI = '<this-period>'
            and C.DELFLG = ''.
#+END_SRC

**** Legal View C for Consolidation & Report
Based on ACDOCC, those approved flexible uploaded data of current period. The view is created on ACDOCC join with the pull request table on document number. The pull request table should first filter out these items with user status equals 'Approved'.
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  create view I_PULL_REQ_A as 
    select MODEL, BPC_CATT, FYEAR, FPERI, ENTITY, BELNR, max(CTIME)
            from RTC_PULL_REQ
            where USTATUS = 'Approved'
              and REQ_TYPE = 'FLEXUPL'
            group by MODEL, BPC_CATT, FYEAR, FPERI, ENTITY, BELNR;

  select * from ACDOCC as C
           join I_PULL_REQ_A as P
             on A.MODEL = P.MODEL

            and A.RCOMP = P.ENTITY
            and A.BELNR = P.BELNR
          where P.MODEL = 'RTC001'

            and P.BPC_CATG = 'Actual'
            and P.POPER = '<this-period>'
            and C.DELFLG = ''.
#+END_SRC

**** Legal View A for Validation 
Based on ACDOCA, those current period data in ACDOCA. The view is created on "Foundation View" based on ACDOCA, join with the pull request table on timestamp. The pull request table should first filter out these items with user status equals 'Raised' or 'Approved'.
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  create view I_PULL_REQ_R as 
    select MODEL, BPC_CATT, FYEAR, FPERI, ENTITY, CLOSE_TIME, max(CTIME)
            from RTC_PULL_REQ
            where ( USTATUS = 'Raised' or USTATUS = 'Approved' )
              and REQ_TYPE = 'REALTIME'
            group by MODEL, BPC_CATT, FYEAR, FPERI, ENTITY, BELNR;

  select * from I_FACDOCA as A
           join I_PULL_REQ_R as P
            and A.RYEAR = P.FYEAR
            and A.POPER = P.FPERI
            and A.RCOMP = P.ENTITY
            and A.TIMESTAMP <= P.CLOSE_TIME
          where P.MODEL = 'RTC001'

            and P.BPC_CATG = 'Actual'
            and P.POPER = '<this-period>'.
#+END_SRC

*Note:* =Should check if defer case can be fulfilled in such cases=.

**** Legal View A for Consolidation 
The pull request table should first filter out these items with user status equals 'Approved'. Delta consolidation is still a restriction. 
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  create view I_PULL_REQ_A as 
    select MODEL, BPC_CATT, FYEAR, FPERI, ENTITY, CLOSE_TIME, max(CTIME)
            from RTC_PULL_REQ

            and P.BPC_CATG = 'Actual'
            and P.POPER = '<this-period>'.
#+END_SRC

**** Legal View A for Reporting 
The pull request table should first filter out these items with user status equals 'Approved' and system status equals "Finished". 
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  create view I_PULL_REQ_F as 
    select MODEL, BPC_CATT, FYEAR, FPERI, ENTITY, CLOSE_TIME, max(CTIME)

            and P.BPC_CATG = 'Actual'
            and P.POPER = '<this-period>'.
#+END_SRC

**** Preliminary View C
Latest data in ACDOCC if there are flexible uploaded data in this period.
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select * from ACDOCC
          where MODEL = 'RTC001'
            and RYEAR = '2016'
            and BPC_CATG = 'Actual'
            and POPER = '<this-period>'
            and DELFLG = ''.
#+END_SRC

**** Preliminary View A
latest data in ACDOCA of current period.
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select * from I_FACDOCA
          where RYEAR = '2016'
            and POPER = '<this-period>'.
#+END_SRC


*** Foundation View     :Blang:
The foundation view should be built using HANA calculation view(graphic). 

*** Auto-generation of the 8 HANA Calculation Views      :Steve:
There is an exiting ABAP API to support generation of HANA calculation view. 

*** Write-back using HANA temp table
To be planned!

*** First Release
In 1610 release, we can't achieve the full picture of the diagram. But we can try to simplified it by removing the status control in the data submition process. That means, once the local accountants submit the data, without any approval, BPC can read the data. 

This simplification has following restrictions:
1. Once the local accountant raise the pull request, it is approved automatically, and group accountant can only accept it. There is no embedded control on this process, group accountant must notify the local accountant externally if she doesn't want the data. 
2. Delta consolidation is still not possible. Each time the local accountant raise a new pull request, BPC will always do a full re-consolidation based on the new timestamp. 
3. You can not defer amount to next period.
4. If consolidation is in "RUNNING" or "ERROR" status, reporting will produce data inconsistency.

The simplified diagram would look like this:
