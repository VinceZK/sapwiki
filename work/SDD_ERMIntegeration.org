BC sets are snapshot of customization settings that can be used later as template or customization backup. BC sets can also be used in group rollouts where the customization settings can be compiled for pilot and passed on in a structured way to other rollout locations.

** Context
Validation Engine(VE in short) originally designed for OP needs to be migrated to support the Cloud. The migration happens on the concept level. All the codes and tables in the OP release won't be used any more. 

The new Validation Engine for Cloud(VEC in short) is built upon the Enterprise Rule Model(ERM in short), which is a new rule framework that will replace the old BRFplus and HRF. We cannot reuse the VE OP codes as ERM is totally re-architected. And we also need to support Cloud content lifecycle management, which requires validation rules can be delivered as contents, as well as the supporting of Q2P process. 

The modeling concept is split off. Unlike the OP release, we won't generate CDS views based on a model definition. We manually deliver CDS views as the vocabularies of validation rules. The following diagram shows more in detail.

#+Caption: Architecture of Validation Engine for Cloud
[[../image/ValidationEngineCloud.png]]

1. The CDS views are manually created and registered in the BRFplus application as data objects. The model concept has been eliminated. 
2. The BRFplus application is also pre-defined for consolidation only.
3. Validation rules are defined through our own Fiori APP, and reflected in BRFplus as decision tables. Each rules will also generate a ruleset which only contains the rule itself. The ruleset is then assigned to a BRFplus function which afterwords generate a DB procedure.
4. Validation method corresponds to a ruleset in BRFplus, which is used to include multiple rules. The ruleset is also assigned to a function and the DB procedure as the executable for multiple rules running in parallel.

** Developing Validation Rule in ABAP or JAVA

*** Develop in ABAP
#+Caption: Develop in ABAP
[[../image/VEC_ABAP.png]]

1. Validation Rule maintenance UI(Fiori) is deployed in S/4HANA.
2. Validation Rule OData service is developed and run in ABAP.
3. Call OData service in SCP for the ERM rule compilation and persistence.
4. ERM will synchronizes the runtime objects into S/4HANA, represented as BRFplus objects.
5. Validation Rule's own attributes will be persisted in S/4HANA.
6. As such, a validation rule is split into 2 parts: ERM objects and own attributes. With ERM's design-time objects and run-time objects be persisted in SCP, and BRFplus run-time objects and own attributes be persisted in S/4HANA. Data consistency cannot be guarantee, for example, if calling ERM OData services are succeeded, but calling ABAP OData service is failed, then the data in S/4HANA side is lost.  
7. Content and lifecycle management of ERM rules are handled in SCP side.
8. Content and lifecycle management of Validation Rule's own attributes are separately handled from ERM. However, it is supposed that changing on these attributes doesn't require the rule complication.
9. To mitigate the potential data inconsistency, we should also persist own attributes in SCP. Then JAVA development is unavoidable, see next section.

*** Develop in JAVA
#+Caption: Develop in JAVA
[[../image/VEC_JAVA.png]]

1. Validation Rule maintenance UI(UI5) is deployed in SCP.
2. Validation Rule OData service is developed and run in JAVA. The OData services may merge the APIs of ERM rule with own attributes CRUDA to achieve data atomic. 
3. ERM is responsible for synchronizing run-time objects to S/4HANA, Validation Rule should also be responsible for synchronizing own attributes to S/4HANA.
4. In other words, Validation Rule's own attributes are double persisted in both SCP and S/4HANA. And if data inconsistency happens, it only believes SCP's persistency, and refresh the persistency in S/4HANA side.
5. The Validation Run APP still resides in S/4HANA side, which can invoke the run-time objects.

*** Development Landscape
The development landscape should be the same with ERM. Questions to Carsten:
1. What will be ERM's development landscape? Considering the SCP and S4HANA integration.
2. How ERM release its product to SCP?
3. How Consolidation Validation achieve dependecny on ERM so that they can be enabled together?

*** How to Embed Business Rule UI?
The old HRF UI control in XSC is not allowed anymore. For Cloud APPs who need to embed the new UI control, they must use SCP Business Rule UI control. However, how to embed the new UI control is still not clear. 
1. There is no documentation on the new UI control yet.
2. How the service is deployed and consumed is not clear. If the UI control service is in SCP, our APP resides in S4HANA, and they are in different domain. What's the deployment and configuration?

I should say this part is a high risk for us. Without the readiness of this part from ERM site, we can hardly continue solid design.  

Refer: https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/RULES/ERM+-+UIs

*** Integrate Own Attributes into ERM Meta-data
How to integrate our own attributes into ERM meta-data for a streamline content and lifecycle management?

**** Save Own Attributes in Own Table
Data Consistency Issue

**** Extent ERM tables
1. ERM Extension currently doesn't exist.
2. How Extensions are delivered? Extensions should be delivered as standard program, or content deliver team can do nothing.
3. Table structure extension is not allowed.

**** Eliminate own attributes
Check if it is possible to fully reuse ERM without any own attributes.

| Validation Engine Object | ERM Object | Missing Attributes                |
|--------------------------+------------+-----------------------------------|
| Method                   | Service    | Rule group hierarchy              |
| Rule                     | Rule       | Drill-through reports, ctrl level |
 
*** Questions

**** Whether we can call the JAVA API of ERM?
SCP rest 
ABAP API --> OData

**** What's ERM's tenancy approach?

**** The readiness of ERM Proxy should be put in higher priority
Should be ready in 1805 together with formular rule. 

**** The ERM extensibility concept should be confirmed in more detail
Like if the extended attributes can be synced to runtime repository? How extensions are delivered to customer considering the content and transportation

There is actually no extensiblity on rules, but extensibiltiy on data objects, projects.
** UI
*** Fiori Launchpad on SCP
Besides S/4HANA's Fiori Launchpad definition, you can also define Fiori Launchpad objects in SCP with the so-called FaaS. 

You must enable the "Portal" service in the SAP Cloud Platform cockpit. Then your configure the Portal service by assigning roles and create a site. For details, refer [[https://help.hana.ondemand.com/cloud_portal_flp/frameset.htm?10b3611a95434f4da08c0781974ef82d.html][online help]]. 

** Content Managment
VEC has 3 objects: Rule, Tagged Amount, and Selection. The relationship of them is Selection is used by Tagged Amount, and Tagged Amount is used by Rule. VEC follows following steps to integerate with the Content framework.

(D=Content Development System, Q=Quality System, P=Production System)

*** D: VEC Rule, Tagged Amount, and Selection Creation
Rule, Tagged Amount, and Selection are created using Fiori APP. Use ABAP class "/FTI/CL_WEBGUI_SSCUI" to record contents.

#+BEGIN_SRC abap  
go_fti_webgui_sscui = /fti/cl_webgui_sscui=>create_instance(
                      iv_activity_id   = gc_activity_id
                      iv_object_name   = gc_object_id
                      iv_cust_obj_type = gc_object_type ).
#+END_SRC
