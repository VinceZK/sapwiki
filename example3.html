<h1>1 Abstract</h1>
<p>Real-time Consolidation(RTC in short) provides corporation the ability of generating consolidated financial statements and reports on-the-fly. RTC is built on Central Finance(CF in short),<span style="line-height: 1.42857;background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;which acts as a central repository for all the financial data, it synchronizes journals from sub systems in a real-time fashion. RTC does consolidations directly based on the central journal repository. There is no additional data replicas needed, Consolidation experts can do pre-consolidations at anytime, without notifying sub financial system to close first.Thus he/she can find problems before year-end closing consolidation actually happens. This permits corrections can be made in sub systems before-hand. Besides, consolidation rules can even be applied in the document posting processes, which guarantee efficient and effective financial controls.</span></p>

<p class="BulletedList"><strong style="line-height: 1.42857;background-color: transparent;">Year-End close (pre)consolidation</strong></p>
<p class="BulletedList">Traditional consolidation takes days. It needs to extract data from group's sub financial systems, which needs the sub systems finish the closing first. Then transform the data, and load it to the consolidation system. The overall closing and ETL process are very time-consuming. No bother to mention if corrections are needed, the entire process could be re-processed. Corporation stakeholders suffers waiting too long a period for consolidated statements. While Real-time Consolidation can perfectly solve the problem. RTC is based on Central Finance which acts as a central repository for all the financial data, it synchronizes journals from sub systems in a real-time fashion. RTC does consolidations directly based on the central journal repository. There is no additional data replicas needed, Consolidation experts can do pre-consolidations at anytime, without notifying sub financial system to close first.Thus he/she can find problems before year-end closing consolidation actually happens.

<h1>3 Boundary Conditions</h1>
<p>Real-time Consolidation is run on Central Finance. It is under the assumption that CF is correctly implemented, that data in all the sub financial systems is synchronized real-timely. Based on the central journal repository, RTC generates consolidation models and interfaces for the consumption by existing consolidation tools, like: BPC, BCS, and so on. In the initial releases, RTC will consider the BPC as the main consolidation front-end tools, or the inter-actor.</p>

<h2>3.3 Reuse</h2>
<p>List the reuse components (engines, objects, intrinsic/common services, 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;party components) which have to be used for this development program/project/topic/integration scenario. Mention reuse components which explicitly must not be used within this development program.</p>
<p>General Principles for Reuse</p>
<ul>
<li>Take reuse into account in every architecture definition. Well planned reuse has a big positive influence on stability, quality, common look and feel, TCO and TCD of the complete application.</li>
<li>But consider the costs in relationship to the benefits when reusing a function or feature from others. In especially check if the prerequisites (system, hardware, licenses, implementation and customizing efforts, etc) which are required to use the reuse functions are acceptable for customers. If you answer one of the following questions with yes please consult with your local reuse expert</li>
<li>Does the used service or functionality force the customer to install an additional system?</li>
<li>Does the usage of a service or functionality force the customer to implement and customize a new application or technology hub?</li>
<li>Does the new framework or functionality which is planned exist in a similar version in other areas (Examples are rules engines, business object frameworks, master data, &hellip; )?</li></ul>
<p>Recommendations</p>
<p>If you want to develop a new framework or functionality which could be of interest for other groups too, please check whether synergies would be possible.</p>
<p>The following reuse components must / should / must not be used within this development:</p>

<h2>3.4 Cross-Release Compatibility</h2>
<p>Describe boundary conditions to ensure smooth upgrade / migration.</p>
<p>General Principles for Cross-Release Compatibility</p>
<p>A new release of an SAP application can always be integrated with any release of any other SAP application that is still in mainstream and extended maintenance. After an upgrade of an SAP application, all previously used scenarios are still available.</p>
<p>Release Synchronization schema to be followed (Details see&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="https://portal.wdf.sap.corp/go/releasemanagement" rel="nofollow">/go/releasemanagement</a>)]</p>
<h2>3.5 Other External Forces / Constraints and Assumptions</h2>
<p>Describe other external forces, constraints and assumptions, which influence or restrict your architecture. This could also be resource, skillset and timeline constraints, etc.</p>
<p>Real-time Consolidation highly depends on Central Finance. CF provides the data bases for the RTC to consume. The successfully implementation of CF puts directly impacts on RTC.</p>
<p>BPC is the only legal consolidation and planning product in SAP. RTC may be bundled with BPC for sales and marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>4 Architecture Definition</h1>
<p>The architecture chapter shall describe the main building blocks of the architecture and their relationships. Depict also how the building blocks are integrated with building blocks outside the program/topic. This section can be structured into sub-chapters.]</p>
<p>For conceptual and technical architecture diagrams use Technical Architecture Modeling (TAM):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://ency.wdf.sap.corp:1080/Modeling/Standard/" rel="nofollow">http://ency.wdf.sap.corp:1080/Modeling/Standard/</a>. Provide at least one overview picture of the topic (TAM block/component diagram) and an according description. You are welcome to provide more diagrams according to TAM.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.1 Architecture Context and Overview</h2>
<p>Describe how the software developed within this project relates to existing SAP software,</p>
<p>Provide an architecture overview diagram which depicts all major component and their relationships. Describe the overall architecture concept and explain the role of each component.</p>
<p>We recommend to describe the architecture according to the following sequence</p>
<p>First, explain the concepts, on which the architecture is based. This may be business concepts, technical concepts or patterns. ARIS diagrams block diagrams, or entity-relationship diagrams may be useful for visualization.</p>
<p>Second, give the component view of your architecture. What are the building blocks and how do they relate to each other. Include a block diagram.</p>
<p>Third, describe behavior of the system/components (dynamic view). You may use an activity diagram to visualize it.</p>

<h2>4.4 Security</h2>
<p>Describe how the architecture protects the software against attacks or misuse.</p>
<p>To do so, define how communication channels (protocol, data, ...) are protected. Describe how authentication, authorization and logging are performed. Consider architecture requirements pertaining to confidentiality, integrity and availability.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.5 Deployment and Operations</h2>
<p>It is recommended to work with the local Technical Component and Delivery Architecture (TCDA) team on defining deployment and operations architecture. Contact is the &ldquo;Delivery Architecture Engineer&rdquo; maintained in&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="https://ifp.wdf.sap.corp/sap/bc/bsp/sap/zpr/default.htm" rel="nofollow">program repository</a><u>&nbsp;</u>entry of your program.</p>
<h3>4.5.1 Deployed Component Structure and Deployment Options</h3>
<p>Show all interdependencies of (groups of) software components using a package diagram (TAM). Assign the components to software layers, for example see:&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/display/archGov/Software+Layers" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/display/archGov/Software+Layers</a></p>
<p>Describe software component structure, package structure and their deployment options. Deployment options describe the different possibilities how the software components can be distributed across different systems. Indicate cross-component communication. Mention explicitly, if there are new dependencies between software components.</p>
<p>Describe deployment unit and process component structure if relevant.</p>
<h3>4.5.2 System Landscape</h3>
<p>Describe typical system landscape required to run the software developed within this program&nbsp;<u>productive</u>&nbsp;at a customer site. Show how the main deployable building blocks are distributed within that landscape. Determine which landscape components are mandatory and which are optional to run the software</p>
<h3>4.5.3 Operation Concept</h3>
<p>Describe how the planned software is operated and estimate the impact on TCO. This includes a rough description of complexity of installation, configuration, update, monitoring, and troubleshooting. Explain also how easy product and landscape optimization can be done during product lifecycle (such as scalability and high availability).</p>
<p>In case TCO is high, explain a roadmap how simplification in next versions can be done (for example from complexity hiding to complexity reduction).</p>
<h2>4.6 Testing</h2>
<p>Think about the test approach, especially if you enter new technology areas where the existing test tools cannot be used or where the existing test tools need to be enhanced.</p>
<h2>4.7 Architecture Details (Further Refinement)</h2>
<p>Use further chapters to refine the architecture and describe specific topics.</p>
<h2>4.8 Architecture Risks</h2>
<p>Explain your view on architecture-related risks and give hints about potential upcoming problems. Risks can arise for example from changes in the scope, from work-arounds necessary, from dependencies on other components, or from immature technologies/concepts. Fill in the table for each risk.</p>
