<p>Real-time Consolidation(RTC in short) provides corporation the ability of generating consolidated financial statements and reports on-the-fly. RTC is built on Central Finance(CF in short), which acts as a central repository for all the financial data, it synchronizes journals from sub systems in a real-time fashion. RTC does consolidations directly based on the central journal repository. There is no additional data replicas needed, Consolidation experts can do pre-consolidations at anytime, without notifying sub financial system to close first.Thus he/she can find problems before year-end closing consolidation actually happens. This permits corrections can be made in sub systems before-hand. Besides, consolidation rules can even be applied in the document posting processes, which guarantee efficient and effective financial controls. test test</p>

<h2><span>2</span> Background and Context</h2>
<p>Provide in this chapter information why this architecture concept was created (for which business needs, for which use cases, for which formal requirements, etc.) and provide some key information about the context of the concept.</p>

<h3><span>2.5</span> Business Case</h3>
<p>Consolidation is discussed in 80 % of the cases of which we have customer discussions on Central Finance. Central Finance carries all Financial Data from the entire system landscape. It is not understood by the customers why they need to load the data from somewhere else for the consolidation. Group Reporting on Central Finance has limited informative value without consolidation. Central Finance is supplied in real-time. Necessary corrections in local close are updated real-time. There is no need for the waiting time of ETL.</p>
<h3><span>2.6</span> Main Use Cases / Functional Scope</h3>
<h4><span>2.6.1</span> Year-End close (pre)consolidation</h4>
<p>Traditional consolidation takes days. It needs to extract data from group's sub financial systems, which needs the sub systems finish the closing first. Then transform the data, and load it to the consolidation system. The overall closing and ETL process are very time-consuming. No bother to mention if corrections are needed, the entire process could be re-processed. Corporation stakeholders suffers waiting too long a period for consolidated statements. While Real-time Consolidation can perfectly solve the problem. RTC is based on Central Finance which acts as a central repository for all the financial data, it synchronizes journals from sub systems in a real-time fashion. RTC does consolidations directly based on the central journal repository. There is no additional data replicas needed, Consolidation experts can do pre-consolidations at anytime, without notifying sub financial system to close first.Thus he/she can find problems before year-end closing consolidation actually happens. This permits corrections can be made in sub systems before-hand. Besides, consolidation rules can even be applied in the document posting processes, which guarantee efficient and effective financial controls.</p>

<h2><span>3</span> Boundary Conditions</h2>
<p>Real-time Consolidation is run on Central Finance. It is under the assumption that CF is correctly implemented, that data in all the sub financial systems is synchronized real-timely. Based on the central journal repository, RTC generates consolidation models and interfaces for the consumption by existing consolidation tools, like: BPC, BCS, and so on. In the initial releases, RTC will consider the BPC as the main consolidation front-end tools, or the inter-actor.</p>

<h3><span>3.3</span> Reuse</h3>
<p>List the reuse components (engines, objects, intrinsic/common services, 3rd party components) which have to be used for this development program/project/topic/integration scenario. Mention reuse components which explicitly must not be used within this development program.</p>
<p>General Principles for Reuse</p>
<ul>
    <li>Take reuse into account in every architecture definition. Well planned reuse has a big positive influence on stability, quality, common look and feel, TCO and TCD of the complete application.</li>
    <li>But consider the costs in relationship to the benefits when reusing a function or feature from others. In especially check if the prerequisites (system, hardware, licenses, implementation and customizing efforts, etc) which are required to use the reuse functions are acceptable for customers. If you answer one of the following questions with yes please consult with your local reuse expert</li>
    <li>Does the used service or functionality force the customer to install an additional system?</li>
    <li>Does the usage of a service or functionality force the customer to implement and customize a new application or technology hub?</li>
    <li>Does the new framework or functionality which is planned exist in a similar version in other areas (Examples are rules engines, business object frameworks, master data, ? )?</li></ul>
<p>Recommendations</p>
<p>If you want to develop a new framework or functionality which could be of interest for other groups too, please check whether synergies would be possible.</p>

<h3><span>3.4</span> Cross-Release Compatibilty</h3>
<p>Describe boundary conditions to ensure smooth upgrade / migration.</p>
<p>General Principles for Cross-Release Compatibility</p>
<p>A new release of an SAP application can always be integrated with any release of any other SAP application that is still in mainstream and extended maintenance. After an upgrade of an SAP application, all previously used scenarios are still available.</p>
<p>Release Synchronization schema to be followed (Details see<a href="https://portal.wdf.sap.corp/wcm/ROLES://portal_content/cp/roles/cto/DevelopmentResources/ReleaseStrategyTransparency/Infocenters/WS%20PTG/PTG/Operations%20%26%20Program%20Office/Release%20Management">/go/releasemanagement</a>)</p>
<h3><span>3.5</span> Other External Forces / Constraints and Assumptions</h3>
<p>Describe other external forces, constraints and assumptions, which influence or restrict your architecture. This could also be resource, skillset and timeline constraints, etc.</p>
<p>Real-time Consolidation highly depends on Central Finance. CF provides the data bases for the RTC to consume. The successfully implementation of CF puts directly impacts on RTC.</p>
<p>BPC is the only legal consolidation and planning product in SAP. RTC may be bundled with BPC for sales and marketing.</p>
<h2><span>4</span> Architecture Definition</h2>
<p>The architecture chapter shall describe the main building blocks of the architecture and their relationships. Depict also how the building blocks are integrated with building blocks outside the program/topic. This section can be structured into sub-chapters.</p>
<p>For conceptual and technical architecture diagrams use Technical Architecture Modeling (TAM): <a href="http://ency.wdf.sap.corp:1080/Modeling/Standard/">http://ency.wdf.sap.corp:1080/Modeling/Standard/</a>. Provide at least one overview picture of the topic (TAM block/component diagram) and an according description. You are welcome to provide more diagrams according to TAM.</p>
<h3><span>4.1</span> Architecture Context and Overview</h3>
<p>Describe how the software developed within this project relates to existing SAP software, Provide an architecture overview diagram which depicts all major component and their relationships. Describe the overall architecture concept and explain the role of each component.</p>
<p>We recommend to describe the architecture according to the following sequence First, explain the concepts, on which the architecture is based. This may be business concepts, technical concepts or patterns. ARIS diagrams block diagrams, or entity-relationship diagrams may be useful for visualization.</p>
<p>Second, give the component view of your architecture. What are the building blocks and how do they relate to each other. Include a block diagram.</p>
<p>Third, describe behavior of the system/components (dynamic view). You may use an activity diagram to visualize it.</p>

<h3><span>4.9</span> Planned Design Documents</h3>
<p>Here the sprint teams can list the software design documents (SDD), which will be created in order to implement the architecture. The list can also be created over time.</p>
<h2><span>5</span> Glossary</h2>
<p>Add definitions of terms which are relevant for understanding the document to the glossary. As alternative add the terms to the architecture <a href="https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/ArGlossary/Contribute+to+SAP%27s+Architecturepedia">architecture glossary in the Wiki</a>.</p>
